In just a few days, I'm gonna be filthy rich.

Ah man, the look on my friends' faces when I told them I'll be running the Red Mile was priceless. They kept saying "Are you stupid? You're gonna get yourself killed!" or "This is a terrible idea." I couldn't stop laughing. 

I mean, yeah, I don't think any of them would survive the course. They're too doughy, too slow, and can't shoot to save their lives. But me? I'm different. I can run a 14-minute mile without breaking a sweat. I've even gone camping more times than I can count. 

They're just too embarrassed to admit that I've got what it takes, but they don't, and never will. It's actually kind of insulting that they think I won't survive, but I'll show them. And then, when I'm done gloating, I'll do it all again!
