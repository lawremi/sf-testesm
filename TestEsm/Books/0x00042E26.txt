I don't know why they came after us, but they did. They had no idea what they were looking for, they just knew that there was something here. So I did what you told me and made sure they never found it. 

Unfortunately, they disabled our grav drive and pretty much everything else. So I guess we'll be floating out here forever, but hey, at least I kept it safe.
