Hey foreman, Dundas and Curtis were able to scrounge up some guns for the ship. For a miner, Curtis has a nose for weapons. Nenadovic has some suggestions on where to hit remote ships, so we're finally underway. Two or three wins should give us a good haul and then we'll head back.

I'm glad to hear the crew is coming together. This was a tough ask, but I think you chose the right people. Yuliana Riseu is a good friend and has never let me down. Thank you for taking her husband Rizky on as well, I know he can be a lot in cramped quarters, but he is a hard worker. I didn't think Aurel would volunteer, but he knows how desperate we are and is always ready to help.

You know we're struggling here, and I know you won't let us down.

Hey again, we're in position. Everyone is excited, Rizky maybe too much. But it feels really good to be on this side, hope you'll join us next time. Hate to say it, but mining is for chumps. No offense. 

Don't know how long we'll have to wait, but we can keep ourselves busy. I'm shutting some things down so folks don't give away our position, so you won't hear from us until we're ready to return.
