Not even sure this is legally binding, but here goes.

I lost it all. All of my credits. I lost my ship. I'm supposed to pay for this hotel room, but I can't even do that, and I don't know how I'm going to get off this rock. I'm doing the only thing I can, and signing up to run the Red Mile. If I don't come back, this document serves as my final wishes.

To my mother, Michela, I leave my Meatball Shop, the Spicy Spacey Meatball. I know it was yours to begin with, but you'll know what to do with it better than Gino will.

To my son, Gino, you can have everything in my apartment, especially the music collection. There's some real jams in there. Take good care of it. Sorry I wasn't a better dad.

To my ex-wife, Marla, I leave you exactly what you left me: nothing. You can die mad about it for all I care.
