Did you see Kenny's memo? The boss is coming out here, and we have to hide all the "party supplies". I'll take care of everything in our room, you get the stuff from your locker.

Keys for the container are in the breakroom. Or they were, before Austin stashed his stuff. You know how he is. 

Get this done QUICK. Kenny's been driving me crazy about it all day.
