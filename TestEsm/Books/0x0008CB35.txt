So you're on the lookout for a habitable planet? Well, aren't we all!

The League of Independent Settlers defines a habitable planet as any one that:

  1.) Has a breathable atmosphere.
  2.) Has a safe temperature. 

And that's it. Yes, it's really that simple! 

Here's a tip. When in doubt, go where the life is! If flora and fauna can exist on a planet, there's a good chance we humans can too.

LIST thanks you for all of your hard work. Now go forth and settle the stars!
