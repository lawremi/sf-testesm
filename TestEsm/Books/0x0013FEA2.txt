Lana, I've been thinking about it, and the only way we're going to be free of your psycho ex is to disappear out there... somewhere. We can contact LIST, get a lead on a habitable world, and start over. Away from the cities, away from the United Colonies and Freestar Collective. I have enough saved us for us to make a good start. What do you think? We can discuss it in person when I see you tomorrow.
