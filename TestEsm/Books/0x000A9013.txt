This tresure belongs to Captin Galaxy of the Crimson Fleat! I have left it here to hide it from the Freestar Rangers. 

If you are a pirate, then you can have a snack. If you are not a pirate, then watch out! A wizard put a spell on my tresure, and if anyone takes it who is not a pirate, they will die!!! So be careful.
