Sometimes when Amanirenas tells stories of her wars against the Romans... Is she really reincarnated? I mean, the details - just how much emotion she expresses. When I came to the Believers it's because I think the Mission is right. I may not know who I am (maybe one of the Chinese Emperors? That just feels right? Wouldn't it be wild if I was Sun Tzu?) but I just know in my bones that the worlds outside are in a terrible state.

Whoever built all of this, they had a good reason. But after being with Amanirenas so long, it's hard not to get swept away in it. Are we the tip of the spear of a real Golden Age?
