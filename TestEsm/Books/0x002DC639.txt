Rick, I could kiss you! 
Your documents worked! They even loaded the ship FOR US! Haha! Usually we use up ammo whitelining these sharks, this time they GAVE IT TO US. They've probably figured it all out by now and are PISSED, so we're coasting on silent until we hit the rendezvous point.
See you soon!

PS - Johnny is a cranky baby. Where'd you find this guy?
PPS - Did you set the computer language to French? How do I change it?

Where are you? Johnny tells me we're at the spot. Hurry up, he's getting on my nerves.

Don't tell me you're passed out under ANOTHER table again. 
We celebrate AFTER the job you idiot.
At least tell your goon here how to get this ship to talk English. His veins are popping. I can't take another day of this.

Are you even getting these? Or is this stupid machine blocking all our messages too? Because she sure as hell isn't RECYCLING OUR OXYGEN. Maybe Johnny's button mashing messed it up. All I can smell is his sweat. Ugh.
If you don't get here soon I might have to encourage him to take a walk out the airlock. If I do, I'm getting his share, NOT YOU.

You had exactly ONE THING TO DO, which I believed was enough for your SMOOTH LITTLE BRAIN!!!
But either I was wrong, and you're a bigger IDIOT than I imagined... or you're STABBING US IN THE BACK, which means you're a bigger CREEP than I ever imagined.
