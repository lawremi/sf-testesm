I've been hearing rumblings about ranchers and homesteaders around these parts complaining about getting harassed about their land. Now I'm not saying we couldn't be doing this ourselves, it'd be slim pickings if you ask me. What I am saying is, if we're not doing it, we better be making sure it isn't coming back on us.
