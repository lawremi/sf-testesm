The Captain had everyone fooled. Almost everyone.

I can't believe I followed their ridiculous plan right into this death trap.

I should've spoken up when they suggested it, and now I'm paying the price for their foolishness.

But who's the bigger fool, right? It's not the one who came up with the plan, and it's not the one who follows it blindly. It's the one who follows it against their better judgment.
