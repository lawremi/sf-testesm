Jake and the Enu: A Tale of Enlightenment

Part 1:
 
Since he was a boy, Jake's family had protected the Enu, the ancient creatures who brought life to his mountain. Each day, Jake would enter their cave and clean the stone statues that connected the Enu to this world. He kept their location secret, and shielded the Enu from the greedy men who lived in the valley of the mountain. Jake was always kind to his wife and sons, so that he could tell the Enu of his good deeds.
 
The Enu rewarded Jake's devotion by bringing his family the life-giving stream. Each spring, it would flow from the mouth of their cave, and bless his fields with a bountiful harvest. This blessing had only grown stronger each year. Jake's farmland was so prosperous that it covered the mountain, and was seen by those in the valley.
 
One day, two men visited Jake's farm.
 
"Let us buy your grains, and your fruits," They said, "for none will grow, beyond the mountain." But Jake turned them away. 

"The valley has run dry, and surely you could make do with less." But the men's coins were of no use to Jake, for he received all that he needed from the Enu.
 
One night, Jake woke to sounds coming from the Enu's cave. He raced to the entrance, only to find the cave filled with men from the valley. Each one held a Enu statue, and was carrying it down from the mountain.

Jake cried for them to stop, but one man held him at the mouth of the cave. "The lands of the valley are dying." he said, "These spirits can bring us water, but you have kept them all to yourself. We will leave what you have already grown, but we are taking the Enu to the valley."
