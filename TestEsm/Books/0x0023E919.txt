Dragons within! Shussalina, the forgotten daughter of Sarrklon, has assembled the fractured Dragonstar and seeks her revenge! Using the magic of Dragonstar, she covertly travels to the peaceful world of Ploximar, bringing with her a seemingly magical pox, infecting the local populace. What seemed to be a disease turns out to be millions of microdragons, shrunken down to microscopic scale by the power of the reformed Dragonstar. Unbeknownst to her, Tanskler and his new friends Glorp, the gelatinous golem, and Minnialissa, the fae witchling, are on a diplomatic mission to Ploximar when Tanskler falls ill to the dragon pox. His companions shrink down and enter his body to take on the microscopic threat.
