A private citizens guide to the good life.

[The pamphlet is a persuasive argument, that walks the reader through various questionnaires and assessments, that lead to the conclusion that the only way to truly be happy, is to live the life of a homesteader or colonist. It then similarly walks the reader through an argument that convincingly portrays joining LIST as the most sensible and principled way to achieve that end.]
