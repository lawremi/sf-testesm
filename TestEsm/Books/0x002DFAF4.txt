I cannot believe the moment of awakening is upon us. To merge with the Clemens Comet and be eternal. It is really happening.

I tried to convince Susan to come with me one last time, or at least let me bring Malcolm. She refused to listen to my reasoning. She bawled, said I was leaving our son without a father. But she just doesn't understand. It pains me to leave my family to suffer. But if she cannot see, what more can I do? I have tried to pass on The Star Child's message. If she does not want to receive it, I can do no more.

I do not fear what comes next. I know that the great journey is just beginning.
