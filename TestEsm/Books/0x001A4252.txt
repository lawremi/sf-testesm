I found an old book of astrology (apparently I'm a Sagittarius, whatever that means) and get this - my horoscope said that "You should not be afraid of the dark cave and the truths that lie within". Obviously nonsense but it's fitting.  Guess a broken clock is right twice a day! This is the third of the these abandoned shafts that I've gone exploring in and there's tons of good stuff that they just left behind. The advent of laser mining may have been a challenge for these old big machine based mines, but they're a jackpot for scroungers like yours truly. Big mining conglomerates look at a huge piece of machinery and decide it's not worth it to drag it out but someone like me, I can spend a month poking around and tearing out old heat exchangers and make a year's salary selling them to scrappers at Cydonia.
