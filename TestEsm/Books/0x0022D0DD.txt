Dear Jupiter,

Though we've only known each other for five years, I hope you know by now that I think of you as my own. I'm so proud of the young woman you've become, and I want you to know that I'll always love and support you.

Because of this, I'd like to ask your permission to officially adopt you. It would be my honor to be a permanent part of your life. I know it may seem strange since you're already an adult, but I fully intend to grow old with your mother so should anything happen along the way, I want you to know that I have every intention of being there.

This is a big decision, so please take any time that you need. There's no pressure to say yes. I know you already think of me as your father, and that will always be enough. 

All my love,
Dad
