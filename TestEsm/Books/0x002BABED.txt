Matsura: You've given the Fleet a lot of trouble Barrett. 

Barrett: Hey, since when is surviving being attacked "causing trouble"? Isn't that just fighting back?

Hey, pilot, could you move your arm a little bit to the left? I can't make out the console.

Matsura: Don't move! He's trying to figure out our destination! Probably transmitting this conversation right now while we're still in orbit.

Barrett: Well, yeah, thought I was making that pretty obvious.

Okay, okay. Put the gun down. I'm done. See? My retinas are pointing away from the console and towards this lovely view of space we have out the window.

Matsura: Tie him up. Once we get back to the base, the fun starts...
