Hi Anja! I found this slate one of the customers left behind. Tried contacting them but they never came back for it. Anyway, I know they don't like us using newer tech like this here, but I figure I already catch enough flack for working at Chunks that I don't care.

I just wanted to leave this for you to tell you that I love you baby! You're my everything!
