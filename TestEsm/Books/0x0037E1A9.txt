I need to do some routine maintenance on the shields. 

We're heading into some dangerous territory over the next few weeks and you never know.

My checklist:

Power distribution
Shield integrity
EM radiation protection
Energy transfer
Deflection/Absorption
Wear and tear
Driver updates
