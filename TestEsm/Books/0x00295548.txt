I managed to break in to the top floor. It is a spaceship, as we all assumed. The records call it the Galathea.

Most of the ship has been stripped down, but amazingly the comm system was operational. There was a message from another ship called the Beagle. When I played the transmission it was just raw noise.

I will try to go back tonight.
