Gonzalez is going to end up killing Parker one of these days. What does he think's going to happen messing with a guy twice his size? He's like an obnoxious little weasel that just won't go away. Kinda hope he takes it just too far next time so Gonzalez snaps and ends this whole thing. I know that's a shitty thing to say. Still, I hope it happens...
