Plants have shown less than optimal growth the last 2 months with the seasonal change. Not enough sunlight throughout the day, so shutters in this sector need to open an hour earlier so the plants can receive more light. Amount of water seems optimal; sunlight seems to be the issue.

If that doesn't seem to fix the problem, I would check the temperature to make sure it's optimal. I'm sure one of the bots would be happy to monitor that for you as well.
