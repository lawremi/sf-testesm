Wind Turbines continue to ice up. They're the originals, and this being New Homestead and all, it seems fitting to keep them that way. Recommendation is to keep administering repairs. Replacing them, while sensible, is both costly and diminishes the classic appeal of New Homestead. As such, I will decline sending a  proposal to the appropriate parties at the UC Energy Dept.
