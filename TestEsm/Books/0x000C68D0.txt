Dear OCCUPANT, 

Your ship warranty has expired. Gagarin requires that all ships have valid long-term warranties to prevent harm to the landing pads. You have 7 days to comply or your ship will be in violation of the law.

Please deposit 10,000 credits into the "Gagarin Ship Warranties and Insurance" account as soon as possible to avoid penalty fees.
