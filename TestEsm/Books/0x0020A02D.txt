I thought I was ready... I really did. I went into this thinking I'd come out a hero, that I'd be serving some greater good. Who was I kidding.

I saw another pilot take one right in the cockpit. His mech just flopped over, lifeless. We came up through the academy together, and I can't even remember their name. Fitting I suppose. They'll be here, forgotten, entombed in their Mech like a giant high-tech sarcophagus for all eternity.

My Mech is fine, just some minor arm damage, but I've got to get out of here. I'm making a run for it the second I get a chance. If anyone reads this... I'm sorry.
