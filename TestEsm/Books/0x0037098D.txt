Sometimes hauling cargo is like those puzzles you play as a kid. You have to put the pieces in a precise order or else it won't fit. 

This is because in our line of work, crate dimensions don't adhere to any particular standard, or use the same system of measurement. 4 x 8 feet crates will often need to be stacked alongside 3 x 6 meter boxes. Then there's the type of crate. You got fragile goods, dry bulk, wet bulk, etcetera. 

But it's important we be precise. If security does an inspection, they'll see our crates are professionally organized. That goes a long way to looking legitimate.

So when I found the cargo hold a mess after takeoff, I didn't know how to explain it. Maybe it was the condensation on the floors, or crates tumbling over when we hit escape velocity for Moloch I. 

But last night lying in my bed, I heard noises coming from the hold. And I started to wonder if there isn't another explanation that fits.
