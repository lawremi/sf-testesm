I hope you will never read this, because if you have, there's a good chance that I'm dead.  

I decided to run the Red Mile a few weeks ago. Please understand - I wanted to tell you, but I knew you would convince me not to run the course. The bills just kept piling up, and no amount of money we made seemed to be enough. At least this way I could try to provide for you and the kids like I always should have.

As I write this, I know it's a terrible idea. I hope that I'll be able to delete this message, and that we can start a new life with the money I make. But if not, just know that I love you and that I'm sorry. I should've told you and I shouldn't have done this.
