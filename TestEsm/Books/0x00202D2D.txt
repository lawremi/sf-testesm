The Trident Lounge is a courtesy we extend to all prospective customers. Sadly, this courtesy has been abused in recent months so we're establishing new rules. 

* We reserve the right to bar anyone from the lounge and all refreshments. 
* No food or drink may be taken from the lounge. 
* Visiting on consecutive days is not encouraged. Exceptions can be made at Ms. Chen's discretion.
* Have a good time!
