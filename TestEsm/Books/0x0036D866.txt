Pete Nishikawa was a good man. Not great, but good. Just barely too. You're like one unpaid docking ticket from being average.

No, I'm kidding Pete. I just want to make sure not to inflate your ego. You're looking a little light there, and the last thing we need is you hovering over us.

Anyway, if Aleksy is the straight man of the group, then Ensign Nishikawa was the joker. I kind of feel like wherever he went, he made a conscious effort to be the most unserious person in the room.

But he also had a big heart.

Pete was the kind of person who always insisted on paying for drinks, even though he didn't have the creds. He would light up the room with his smile, and would always listen when you needed someone to talk to. Pete, I gotta say, you being on this ship made the void of space feel a little less lonely. Thank you.

Your pal,
