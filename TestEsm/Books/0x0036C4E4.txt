Something's gone wrong. I don't understand, my design was sound, the code compiled correctly, everything should've worked without fail. The AI has taken over the entirety of the upper level. It won't let me communicate with the settlement or use the elevator. I'm a prisoner to this AI... I have to find a way to deactivate it.
