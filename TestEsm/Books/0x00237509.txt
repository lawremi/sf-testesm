Yesterday was amazing! The restaurant was exquisite and you looked beautiful. And after dinner, the night we spent together was unforgettable.

You know I'd do anything for you. All you have to do is ask. I yearn for us to be together, forever. I intend to break things off with my wife and leave that part of my life behind. Be patient, my darling. I'll tell her soon, I promise.

I love you. Now and forever.
