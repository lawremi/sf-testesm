We picked up the ship and are on our way to the depot. I can see why Lysi got a deal on this: the grav drive is absolute garbage. And was it you that set the computer to French? This some kind of joke? Har har. I can pilot this thing, but that's about all "Mademoiselle" will let me do.
I don't care what Lysi says, I vote we drop this hunk of junk into a star when we're done.

While you were in Neon getting high off fish, I was shaking hands with a United Colonies quartermaster and trying to convince him that my computer speaks French because I just love learning useless languages. If he'd have been 1% more suspicious Lysi and I would in an interrogation room right now, singing your name. Or dead.
We're on our way to the rendezvous point. I've turned off everything to avoid the sharks' scanners. Gravity should do the rest. Don't be late.

I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume SysDef is looking for us, forcing you to take the long way around. And to not reply to our messages.

Your girl's voice is driving me crazy. Hurry up.

Water and oxygen recycling stopped. I've tried restarting the engines and pushing us back toward civilization but this POS computer won't let me do a goddamn thing. Did you lock me out?
Was this your plan, you little coward?

Your girl keeps calling me crabby, says I should sleep. That's when she's supposed to kill me, right? Then she signals you to drop in? 
Did she sabotage the jump drive or was it you?
I could be wrong. Lysi certainly denies it. But tell you what, Rick. I'm not laying down. I'm not closing my eyes. In fact, if you're not here within 24 hours I might have to strangle your partner here.
Hurry up.
