Hey family,

I wanted to let you all know that I made it to Neon safe and sound. The Ryujin Apartments are really nice, thank God, and I've already made a few new friends. Getting to know the city has been fun so far. It's sooo different. Also, don't let Gran know, but there's no Sanctum Universum here.

Ryujin Tower is very impressive. Much fancier than the office in New Atlantis. We're on a floor with DRONE and Tranquilitea, so it's nice to take a break and play with the bots or relax in a lobby designed for actual comfort.

I think I'm going to like it here even though I'll miss you all. I'll try and make plans for a vacation soon!

Love and miss you,
