Let me be clear. I am in pain. Excruciating, debilitating pain. And let me tell you, it would be so much easier if I just put syringe to vein and ended my life.

But I am going to continue to fight. I will look the reaper in the eye and tell him to screw off. I will take out my calculator and count down every last breath until he grows bored and leaves. 

I am not fighting just for me. I am fighting for this crew. I love every one of these ridiculous bastards, and if my pain means they have a 0.01% better chance of living, then I will endure it, and do it with a smile.

I am in pain. But I am not dead yet.
