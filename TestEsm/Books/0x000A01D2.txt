Your previous employer negotiated a no-fault Mortgage Foreclosure policy. It means that GalBank can foreclose on the property on <b>NESOI</b> without any credit implications to the current lendee.

If you do let GalBank foreclose, all items on the premises become the property of GalBank. So please clear out all personal effects BEFORE the foreclosure procedure begins.
