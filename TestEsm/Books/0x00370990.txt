We land on Moloch I and it's just arid, rocky desert. Mile after mile of brown. But the Captain checks the coordinates and says the cargo's about twenty paces ahead, at the base of a pillar.

We walk toward it, and sure enough, there's a pile of crates just sitting there in the middle of nowhere. Lottie's confident she can get everything to fit, but I don't know. What exactly is in these things? Who left them here?

I've got questions, and the Captain ain't got any answers. All she can think about is the creds. After what we paid for the shields, can't say I blame her.

But maybe I'll head down to the cargo hold, and take a peek inside before we grav jump to Vectera. Given all this secrecy, I figure the information might be worth something to somebody.
