Things have been tough since Mom left, and Dad died. I'm very alone here, but I'm hanging in there. Dad was never quite the same after she left. And Mom, well... I'm glad she's gone. I never seemed good enough for her. And her new boyfriend was kind of a jerk.

I'm finishing up school, and then, hopefully I can get out of here too. But, it's hard because even though my classes cost next to nothing, I still have lots of expenses and I barely have enough to eat. I only earn scraps from Jae and Anja. It's not like they have tons of credits either. And because I have to take time away from my studies, my grades suffer. It sucks. Why is everything so HARD?

How do other people do this? No one around here has really gone to college except for Dr. Lakota, and maybe that new lady, Joyce. Dr. Lakota doesn't really have time for me, and the few times I went for advice, she was just like, "Stick with it, kid, you'll get there if you put in the work."

I don't know what to do. I thought writing it down would help, but now I just have a place I can remember how bad I feel right now, so that's cool.
