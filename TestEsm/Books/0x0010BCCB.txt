This unit has served us very well. Yet, the time has come for us to admit that without a few new parts, our repairs are not going to last. If we want this to work more than a few days at a time I'm going to need a new deformable nozzle, at least a functional reactive gauge, and some isotopic coolant to refresh the system. it's not much to ask, for all of us, and for this loyal unit, please, find these parts.
