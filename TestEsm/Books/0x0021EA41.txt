I know the last few years have been tough. I know you think we should just hide away from the world, but I can't do that.

We lost so many good people, and the monsters that are responsible are still out there. Their fake serpent god won't punish them for what they did, but someone has to. So it's going to be me.

I've joined the UC Vanguard. I know you'd tell me that's risky, what with our past, but it turns out it's not a problem. Remember how we used to joke about the Den being so lax about patrolling? Turns out that works for their background checks, too. And now, when I find those Zealots, I'll have the UC backing me up. 

They're not getting away. Once I've got my hands on them, we can find out if they've heard of this "Tomisar Ka'dic" you mentioned.

I'll send word when it's over.
