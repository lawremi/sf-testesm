Soldiers of the First,

I just got word that the Freestar Rangers finally caught on to the operation. We have to assume that sooner or later, they'll find us here.

Starting now, we'll keep a regular combat patrol in orbit, with on-deck pilots ready to fly at a moment's notice at the first sign of anything jumping in.

You've probably heard stories about the noble Freestar Rangers and all the good they do. Just remember that they're still puppets of a corrupt and spineless government that turned its back on us, and they aren't coming here to talk.

I know you'll be ready to do what's necessary when the time comes..
