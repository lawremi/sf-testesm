This has been the greatest time in my life. Chasing the tail of the Clemens Comet, together with the only rational people in the universe. We are united in our love and passion for the stars, our dreams of the future, our knowledge that we deserve more than what we have. Never before have I met so many like minded people. For the first time, I am not alone.

I almost wish we did not have to join with the Clemens. It is nice to dream of simply traveling the universe forever, a new colony we have built for ourselves.

But the Awakening waits for no one. I know it is what is best for all of us.
