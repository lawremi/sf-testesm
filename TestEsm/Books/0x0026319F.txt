Managed to bribe a transport pilot who got some footage of Victor Compound.
Pilot counted a whole mess of Syndicate goons (at least 10+). 
He sold me his ID badge for 1000 credits. Wouldn't sign for it, so the Rangers will just have to take my word.

[The rest of the slate contains further details on "Victor Compound." The Compound is on McClure II and it lists the coordinates. There are digital records of a fake ID and details of a cover story to infiltrate the compound. There are no references to Lillian Hart.]
