I've done the calculations, and it is clear that The Star Child is correct. The Clemens Comet has an average tail length of fifty-six million miles. This tail consists largely of plasma and ionized gas. Readings from The Scientific Spiritual indicate that our souls are made of the same ionized gas. From some independent experiments I've conducted on interactions of gases, I have concluded that if we part our souls from our bodies while in the tail of the comet, as The Star Child suggests, they should seamlessly join with the comets tail.

Some have said that I was foolish to do my own calculations. That it would be preposterous to doubt The Star Child.

I say it is foolish not to do your own research.
