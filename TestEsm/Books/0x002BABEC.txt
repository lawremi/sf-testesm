Heller: Can't believe we got into this mess! 

Barrett: Would you be quiet? Trying to make out the grav jump calculations before we're out of range.

Heller: Out of range of what?

Barrett: Out of range of the sensor array on Vectera. Would you keep up? Once we're outside the star system, the bandwidth goes from instant speed to effectively never.

Heller: What good is sending a transmission down there? You going to tell Lin how royally screwed we both are? She doesn't even have a ship.

Barrett: You underestimate how many of my admirers there are in the galaxy, Heller. One of them is bound to show up, looking to reunite with this handsome face.

Heller: We're doomed. Capital "D" doomed.

Barrett: Got it. Okay. Whoever finds this, I'm attaching the interstellar 
coordinates to the metadata on the transmission. Rescue us. Repeat. RESCUE. US.
