Ah, love, let us be true 

To one another! For this world, which seems 

To lie before us like a land of dreams, 

So various, so beautiful, so new, 

Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light, 

Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain; 

And we are here as on a darkling plain 

Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight 

Where ignorant armies clash by night. 

[So reads the final stanza of Matthew Arnold's stirring poem, Dover Beach.]
