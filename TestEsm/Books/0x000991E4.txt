To Whom it May Concern:

If you had a homemade lunch in a clear container with a red top, I confess. I am the one who ate it. It was delicious, and I am now in dire need of the recipe. Please find me at your earliest convenience, preferably with recipe in hand. I will accept any verbal beating you want to give and am more than happy to make up for your loss with credits.
