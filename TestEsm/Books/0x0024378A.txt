I was married to Clarinda in my previous incarnation. Everyone says we were such a cute couple and expects us to get back together. But she's a complete stranger and she's so... old. It's been so very, very awkward. 

She keeps looking at me deeply/romantically. She calls me "dearest" all the time. My friends ask if I'm bringing Clarinda with me, because they're just used to that. It's driving me a little crazy.

As much as I believe in Franklin and the Pragmatist philosophy... I'm seriously considering leaving just to get some distance from her.
