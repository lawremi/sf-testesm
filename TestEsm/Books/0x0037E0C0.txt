At times like this, I remember the words of an old Freestar explorer, which I'll quote here:

Out here in the void of space, there is little hope we'll survive, and little hope we will be found. 

But I hold on to that small hope, for that is what it means to be human. That is what it means to have faith.

So the fact that you are reading this now, that you have overcome the insurmountable odds to arrive at this tiny speck in the cosmos, that means something. We are connected, you and I, as is this entire universe, a miracle written in stardust. And so, we can never be alone.
