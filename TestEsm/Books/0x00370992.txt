These crates we picked up from Moloch I weigh more than a bloody spacetruck. I tell the Quartermaster I think I cracked my dirty brain pushing them and he tells me it's called a "vertebrae," even though I know for a fact he just made that word up. 

Anyway, we're pushing an especially large crate up the ramp, and I call timeout, because I need a break. So I lean back against it and wipe my brow, when suddenly, the crate pushes back. I swear on me mother, the bloody thing SHOOK.

Meanwhile the Quartermaster's pissed because I'm backing away and the crate's sliding back down the ramp. He's calling me a lazy oaf and all manner of childish insults. When I tell him the crate's got something innit, he says "Of course it gots something in it. What do you think we're smuggling, air?" and kicks the thing. I tell him, he shouldn't do that. But he don't listen.
