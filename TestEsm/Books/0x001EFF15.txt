This is the discovery of the century. Those crystals release oxygen by absorbing a mix of the gasses present in the cave's atmosphere. 

We don't know what forms of life could be using this oxygen. We'll have to dig deeper to where the concentration of CO2 is higher.

I will extract a sample of the crystal for further analysis.
