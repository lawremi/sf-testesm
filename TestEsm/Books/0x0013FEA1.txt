So I did it, just like the Sanctum Universum taught me - I went on a grav pilgrimage. I journeyed the stars. I tried, I mean I REALLY tried to get in touch with God, or a higher power, or whatever else is out there. And you know what I found? Nothing. It's all just emptiness. Cold, cruel emptiness. We live, we die, that's it. Complete pointlessness. So why even bother pretending it all matters? Nothing matters. I just don't know how I can go on after this.
