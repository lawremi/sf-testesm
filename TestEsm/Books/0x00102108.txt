I'm having a terminal put in at your desk, and by Solomon Coe, you're going to learn to use the damn thing. I know you like to do things the old-fashioned way, but you're missing out on important messages. It ain't fair to rely on the other Rangers to keep you up to speed all the time.

I ain't going to take no for an answer, so don't kick up a fuss over it. I don't care how stubborn you are, you're getting a terminal and that's that.
