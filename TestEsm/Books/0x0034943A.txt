A friend used to tell me, it's important to be one with the universe, and two with yourself.

Okay, now that I typed it out I realize he said "attuned" with yourself. That makes way more sense.

I think I get it now, being out here, in the depths of space. I can see myself spending more time out here. Just me and the stars.
