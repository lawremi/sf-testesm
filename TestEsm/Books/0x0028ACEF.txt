Day 21, 14:54
Mr. Hughes reported an emergency with the particle accelerator engineering team. Code Blue, full trauma kit on standby. Was it methane poisoning? A bite from some terrifying, venomous lifeform? No. Evidently, Mr. McCarrick dropped a drill on his foot while assembling the containment housing. Minor bruising, not even a sprain. Clearly, we're dealing with dangerous, unknown phenomena here.

Day 64, 01:15
There's been an explosion on the research level. Full security lockdown, alarms blaring. Hughes is trying to regain control. I am, of course, standing by.

Day 64, 05:42
Director Patel ordered us to stand down at 05:00.

We have one presumed fatality: Mr. Aguerro, our chief engineer, was conducting a late-night test when the explosion occurred. There was a brief release of hydrogen gas, quickly contained. No other injuries reported.

The research level is still locked down; there's apparently no way to get down there short of an excavation team. That kills the research schedule for the rest of our tour. I suggested sending a distress signal to see if we could be relieved early. The Director shot it down.

Four more months. Just four more months.
