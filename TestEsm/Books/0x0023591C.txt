I'm asking that you take care of the ship and anyone on board. I don't care how you do it, I just want to be rid of this problem before someone catches on. If someone finds out that I'm having an affair, and that the woman involved ran off with my government-issued ship, I'm sure you'd understand that it would be very bad for me. I'd like to get ahead of that and just chalk it up to a simple theft and destruction. I repeat, the ship MUST be destroyed, or we shall consider the terms of your payment null and void.
