Hey kiddo,

I know this is your first flight, and I just want to wish you luck, and give you some words of advice. Because the truth is, I'm worried. Not about your safety, your mother has that department cornered. 

I'm worried the poets are wrong, and the cynics are right. I'm worried that when you finally live your dream of going to space, that you won't like it.

See, when you were a kid, all you did was wait. You had to wait for school to end so you could watch those space cartoons. You had to wait for your birthday before we bought you that toy spaceship. But most days, you spent waiting until you were old enough. Old enough to take your first piloting lessons, get your first ship, and join your first crew.

Now that you're finally old enough, I'm worried. Because if being a kid is full of waiting, being an adult is about disappointment. It's about getting what you always wanted, only to wonder, is that all there is?

Well, I'm here to tell you, screw the cynics. There are things in life worth waiting for. You and your mother were that for me. I'm hoping and praying this job is that for you.

Shoot for the stars kiddo. We'll be here when you touch back down.
 
Dad
