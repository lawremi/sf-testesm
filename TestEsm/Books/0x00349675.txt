I don't know if you'll ever get to read this. I feel like I should write it anyway, in case something happens. If this somehow ever finds its way to you, I hope it brings you the closure that you need. 

The ship has been getting bombarded by solar flares. The systems are out, and the engines are dead. If by some miracle we're able to get things running again, another flare hits us and we're back to square one. We've been sending SOS signals out, but so far it's just been radio silence. I don't think we'll be able to get out of this one. 

I don't really know what else to say, but I just want you to know that I love you. Give the kids a hug and kiss for me.
