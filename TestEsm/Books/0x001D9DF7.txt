I've just distributed the latest official firmware update for our automated workers, and I have to admit that I already feel everything running a little smoother. The manufacturer claims a 27.6% increase in efficiency, but apparently that can be improved with some software tweaks. At least that's what this new intern is claiming.

Now, I don't have any reason to suspect them but this incredible performance claim is a little off-putting. Their credentials are in order, and I've ran all the necessary background checks and came across no red flags. If I'm to allow this young programmer to run their custom software we may finally be able to focus on our work unimpeded by menial tasks.

Obviously this will need to be kept hush-hush but our scientists and lab workers will benefit greatly.
