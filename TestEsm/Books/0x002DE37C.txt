<b>Setup</b>

Hey foreman, Dundas and Curtis were able to scrounge up some guns for the ship. For a Miner, Curtis has a nose for weapons. Nenadovic has some suggestions on where to hit remote ships, so we're finally underway. Two or three hits should give us a good haul and then we'll head back. 

- Captain Becker


<b>Going Dark</b>

Hey again, we're in position. Everyone is excited, Rizky maybe too much. But it feels really good to be on this side, hope you'll join us next time. Hate to say it, but mining is for chumps. No offense. 

Don't know how long we'll have to wait, but we can keep ourselves busy. I'm shutting some things down so folks don't give away our position, so you won't hear from us until we're ready to return.

- Captain Becker


<b>Everyone's Pirate Names</b>

Good job on the new names everyone! Please stop using the real ones, they aren't scary enough.

Rosemarie is Rummy C
Aurel is The Asp
Lesley is Vulture, but she isn't "the" Vulture
Miladin is Knifeshadow
Rizky and Yuliana are Risky Rover and Firekat

And we're no longer flying the Dancer In the Darkess either!

- Bloody Jurgen, Captain of the Black Dreadnought

<b>Crew Name Suggestions</b>
Date: 4-13-2330

We need to put the fear of God into anyone we attack. As long as folks know we're serious, they should roll right over. No one needs to be shot or stranded. We leave with the goods, and they'll carry on just fine.

Look, we've been raided enough times, this is tough. Knifeshadow had an arm broken, and the Asp's brother is still in a coma from the raid after that, but they're still here because they know we need to be tougher. Give me your best names!

- Bloody Jurgen Sturzstrom, Captain of the Black Dreadnought 


<b>Crew Name</b>

Still accepting suggestions for our crew name. 

The Asp, you're the only one who hasn't given me anything, I need a better commitment.  Risky Rover, I know you have a shtick but the group doesn't share it. Love the enthusiasm but shake up your list and choose a few favorites. The accent is also a bit much, we need to be intimidating.

- Bloody Jurgen Sturzstrom, Captain of the Black Dreadnought


<b>Small Targets</b>

I'm bored too, but we're new at this and need to wait for a small target. Knifeshadow had a few ideas, one will pan out.

- Bloody Jurgen Sturzstrom of the Fists of Titanium, Captain of the Black Dreadnought and scourge of the Big Dark


<b>Aurel Constantin is a hypocrite and a killer</b>

Miladin went in shooting. He wasn't supposed to. But we're pirates, Rizky  shouldn't have been so shocked afterward. They should have been ready for this. Aurel said he didn't want to kill people either. Didn't stop him when the argument got heated and the Captain pulled a gun. Becker went down and everyone started shooting.

Aurel didn't realize I wasn't dead when he gathered up all of the slates and wiped them. Missed this one in the captain's boot just as he missed my breathing.  

He tried to remove all of the evidence and flee in the ship we hit, but I'm letting you know so he can't come home. Don't let him pretend he isn't a killer too.

- Rosemarie
