Mr. Salvino,

I've been with DRONE for five years working in the sales office at Ryujin Tower. While I've enjoyed the experience, it's always been my dream to work on the robots themselves which is why I'm hoping to get your approval to request a transfer to the Ryujin Industries R&D team.

Please, please, please just let me! Working on sales is killing me... and the PEOPLE. I need to get out of here.
