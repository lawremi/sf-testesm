I wish I was a poet. Then I would channel Whitman, and give you a eulogy that would be as lasting as the stars. But alas, my words lack elegance. Sincerity will have to be enough.

I know you blame yourself for this predicament. But we would have died ten times prior if not for your leadership. Remember that run in with the Crimson Fleet? You answered the hail, put on your best pirate voice, and convinced them you were a Captain! 

I can name countless other instances where you steered us away from death's door. And if this is the end, I will take this ending over any other. So many crews lose their lives in an instant, never having the opportunity to express how they feel. Thanks to you, we have this moment, and for that, I am forever grateful.

Your faithful servant,
