<i>Embassy Staff Eyes Only </i>

<b>Security Reminder!
NOTICE!</b>

Effective immediately.

The utility section access door in the conference room was found unlocked. 

Again. 

This cannot keep happening. Leaving that door unlocked poses a direct risk to the Ambassador's privacy and security.

We all need to get into the habit of ensuring it's locked before and after each shift.

This will be your final warning. Lock the damn access door.
