Yara and I have been swinging at the fences for too long for this not to be the big one.  We've gone to too many weird places and looked at too many strange rocks for this to not work out.  This is the last bit of money we have left over from Dad's final gift and it HAS to work out or we're going to be forced to go do desk work for Argos or some other mudhunting job.
