Captain: Nichols, don't play around with the registry. Put your name in there properly.

Nichols: What's wrong? You don't like saying "EARS, protect the King?"

EARS: Protecting user, LaMarr Nichols.

Captain: Sigh. You can have your joke names in there, but for the love of god, please put Nichols and LaMarr in there too. 

Nichols: Fine, fine. I'll add my government name. But only because you said the magic word.

Josefsson: The vocal recognition seems to work though. Looking at the current targeting subroutines, Nichols' protection is listed as a priority. 

Nichols: Hell yeah, as it should be.
