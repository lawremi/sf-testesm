Judith Tatienne: I just don't understand where these calculations came from.

Victor Aiza: There something wrong with the math? I think it's quite straightforward.

Judith Tatienne: That's not what I'm asking! We've had no success extracting even a sample of material from the object. No explanation for the gravitational effects. No motion graph to explain its harmonic frequencies. I can't even a establish a melting point!

Victor Aiza: Judith...

Judith Tatienne: But you've had me building these prototype colliders for months! And now you want me to pump Helium-3 into it based on this equation you've written on a god-damned napkin!

Victor Aiza: I just need you to trust me.

Judith Tatienne: I HAVE been trusting you! We keep slamming our heads against a brick wall, getting nothing, and you keep coming up with something new to try, like you know what's going to happen! Where are you getting your information, Victor?

Victor Aiza: I'm sorry, Judith. I... look, not here, okay? Somewhere off-base. I'll tell you everything. But... I'm not lying okay? We're going to discover something important here. I promise.
