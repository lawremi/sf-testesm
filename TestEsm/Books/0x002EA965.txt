I'm sick and tired of Lillian Hart breathing down our neck, so it's time to end her once and for all. Use the abandoned supply depot on Andromas III and drop some breadcrumbs to lead her there. Call it a "weapons cache" or whatever you want. She won't be able to resist. Once she trips the alarms, have your crew jump her, and kill her. That will give us one less Ranger to worry about.

And Valerie, don't screw this up, or you're going to find yourself floating on the wrong side of an airlock.
