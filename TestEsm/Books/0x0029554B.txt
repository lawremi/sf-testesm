I woke up for the first time right here. And now I bleed.

When first I heard the Mission, I felt a thrill. We were chosen. We would rule again.

But after spending countless days? nights? Who is to say in these windowless halls.

We do nothing. The Facility feeds us, the Facility provides. And we just... argue.

But now we do more. We turned to murder.

I pray you find this, brother of my blood.

Do not trust <u>Bill Hickok</u>. He is not who he seems.
