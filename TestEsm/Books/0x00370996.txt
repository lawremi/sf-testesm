Ever since that dust up with Spacers near Bessel II the robots on this ship have been acting strangely. I've chided the Captain in the past about not running periodic OS checks but we've recently completed a firmware update so I don't think it's that.

Several of the crew members are claiming the robots will on occasion deny them access to the bunks, kitchen, and cockpit, asking them if they have clearance. I've noted that we're dealing with decommissioned UC Navy models, and some sort of remnant programming could be rearing its ugly head.

The start of the errant behavior coincides with the Spacer attack, in which the robots fought admirably. The timing of it can't be ignored.
