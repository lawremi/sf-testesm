Not sure if I can cut through the container. These crates were designed to resist most laser cutters, but it's worth a shot. I've got a better chance with it than with the digipick, anyway.

Probably doesn't make a difference. At this point I'm dead regardless of whether I get it open.

But when I see this crate in hell I want it to know I won.
