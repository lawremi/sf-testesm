Captain: All right, let's see how this baby works.

Nichols: Awesome, are we gonna test out that new turret system? I volunteer Josef as a target dummy.

Josefsson: Very funny, Nichols. You do realize a direct hit from a rubber projectile still, as you say... hurts like hell?

Nichols: That's what I'm counting on buddy.

Captain: Okay, okay, enough with the clown show. You do realize all this is on the record Nichols? Admissible in a court of law?

Nichols: Well, someone has to be the target.

Captain: Good point. EARS, update target settings. Remove combat inhibitors. Protect current user.

Josefsson: Oh no...

Nichols: You low down, dirty...

Josefsson: Eyaaaaagh! That stings!
