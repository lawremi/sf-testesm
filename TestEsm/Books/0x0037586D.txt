So here's me, making us even. On your travels, keep an eye out for a hideout called Vulture's Roost.

It's run by Ecliptic, and home to the largest collection of mercs, lowlifes, and hired guns in the Settled Systems. They got bunks for sleep, and booze to drink. And to top it all off, just about every piece of contraband you ever wished you could steal. 

But they don't take kindly to strangers, so if you're still flying that Taiyo rustbucket with the broken landing gear, I'll let 'em know you'll be limping into port. 

Otherwise, prepare to be shot at. Nothing personal, them's the rules.
