It is with great sadness that I must inform you of your wife's passing. While tapping a particularly fruitful vein, a seismic event occurred that collapsed the area of the mine your wife and many others were working in. She died instantly and was in no pain.

She was a great worker, and we all will miss her dearly. We are continuing the dig in her and the others' honor. 

I am keeping you in my thoughts during this difficult time.

Best,
