Although Earth has been left behind, humanity shares an ancient compact between any form of government and its citizens. All individuals enjoy unalienable rights that may not be infringed. A government shall not intervene in purely private affairs. A colony has complete autonomy on how they are governed and to manage its own interstellar relations. And all individuals, in time of great need, owe the government their arms and, if need be blood, if the collective welfare is threatened.

[Thus starts the original charter for Akila City. It has a list of rights and responsibilities of the citizens, as well as a list of the powers of the government itself. Possibly one of the most important documents in Akila City history.]
