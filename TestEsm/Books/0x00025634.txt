I patched up your old high school backpack. Good as new. There's so many pockets in there! One of them had an old apple and... Well, it's clean now.

I know you're all grown but the backpack has the best storage on the market. Maybe you could use it with Argos? If not, let me know and I'll donate it.

Love, Mom
