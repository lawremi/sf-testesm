Sarrklon is back, for real this time! Jeffrex and princess Laglorial's wedding is cut short by the return of their old nemesis, Sarrklon. Having revealed himself to be a changeling himself, our heroes question who it was they defeated before. Was it a clone, a robot double, or a mind-controlled changeling minion? But solving that mystery will have to wait, as Sarrklon steals the Dragonstar, once again sending the Dragonstar Force on the hunt for the galaxy's greatest power.
