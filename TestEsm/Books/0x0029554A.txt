Years of trial and error and I have attained proficiency enough to call myself a programmer. It is amazing how far things have advanced from my memories.
To think Babbage and I would open this untold world of knowledge and power!

I realize I never will be a masterful programmer, I have no books or texts to advance myself, but the intricacy of the security here is daunting.

The Facility is on full lockdown and the only solution is the Security Override Code. 

But where is it? This part of the Facility was closed to us until Genghis set off his explosions. And even here, there is nothing of the sort. If only I had more time to think, but the monsters lurk in every hall now.

Perhaps the damage to the Facility means this is my final life? A pity. So much more to discover and learn.
