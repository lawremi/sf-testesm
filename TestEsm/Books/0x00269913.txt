The safe we confiscated from the Brado brothers is still sitting in the locked yard.

It's the largest bust we've ever made, but the top-side security office doesn't want it. I think they'd rather keep it down here, so it looks like we're making busts every week.

In reality, we can't even afford to put a camera out in the yard. That safe is a security risk.
