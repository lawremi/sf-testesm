Dear Julia,

I know you were upset that I left the Constant. It wasn't an easy decision for me either, but you know I was unhappy there, drifting aimlessly forever. I hope you understand why I had to go, just as I understand why you had to stay.

Things are going very well for me here in New Atlantis. I have a job working the front desk at a small accounting business while I take classes. I'm not sure what I'm working towards yet, but I'm thinking of either majoring in Earth History, or Media Production so I can work in film. I know, big difference, but you know I've always been jealous of your job aboard the Constant, and now I can pursue something like that on my own!

I've also been seeing someone I met after striking up a conversation while getting lunch one day. Their name is Bodhi, and so far, things are going well with them.

Anyway, I hope this letter finds you soon. Maybe I can come visit next time I hear of the Constant's whereabouts?

Love,
Janet
