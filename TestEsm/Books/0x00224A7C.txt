1. Ensure all Power Interlocks are engaged.
2. On the Lab Control Computer, initiate Degaussing.
3. Toggle the indicated Power Interlocks off, then back on, to degauss.
4. Verify that all Power Interlocks have been successfully degaussed.
5. Once all Interlocks have been degaussed, initiate Frequency Calibration.
    - If the system has not been fully degaussed, this will fail. If it does, restart.
    - If any Interlock is disengaged, this procedure will abort. If it does, restart.
6. Select the desired output frequency.
7. Verify that the intake frequency is stable and meets experimental parameters.
8. Activate the Primary Calibration Control on the front control console.
