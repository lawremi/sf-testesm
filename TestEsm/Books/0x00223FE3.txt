It's not your fault.

I know how hard it is to lose a colleague, especially a friend like Raf. We may not be explorers or soldiers, but there is a measure of risk even in our line of work. He accepted that. We all did.

There was nothing wrong with your test. And knowing Rafael, I'm quite sure he was deliberate and careful. Whatever happened, it was an accident.

Take a few days off. Speak to Tati if you need to. But don't let it eat at you.
