My life is over. It's really starting to settle in now - I'm a dead man walking. If Zeek doesn't kill me, the Red Mile will. 

How did I get into this mess? I never should have taken his money. Everyone warned me about him, too, but of course I didn't listen. I never do, and I guess I won't be alive long enough to learn how to.  

He seemed like a nice guy at first. Gave me all the money I needed to get by. I was really struggling at the time and he was the only one that would help me out. I should've known better. Like mom always told me - everyone wants something, but no one wants to give.  

Zeek is actually the one who put me up to this. Says if I can't pay the interest on his loans, I should give this a shot. "What's the harm?" he said. What an asshole. 

I'm not sure what his endgame is. If I'm dead, I can't ever pay him back. Maybe he's had enough of me and just wants to kill me off, but he doesn't wanna do the dirty work himself. Yeah, sounds like him. 

Well, I'm dead either way. Might as well try and accept it.
