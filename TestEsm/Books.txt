   Title: Waylon Swift's Slate
We're organizing a meeting for a potential mutiny. I've got our list of grievances here, as well as our demands:

Grievances:
1. We feel Anthony is not fit to be Captain of this ship, and their inexperience endangers both the ship and the crew.

2. We believe there is possible foul play involved with Captain Oswalt's sudden illness.

Demands:

1. Relieve Captain Anthony Rakell of all duties and place them in the cargo hold under supervision.

2. Institute Jerian Thybulle as acting Captain until we return to the homestead and can have a proper vote.

3. Access to the old Captain's private health records.

   Title: Race to the Heavens
Up until the wide availability of steel, buildings rarely were over seven stories. The amount of structural support brick buildings needed made going over ten stories effectively impossible. In the early 20th centuries the availability of industrial strength steel and advances in engineering design led to the dawn of the skyscraper. And then the race to the heavens was on. 

Eighty years after the first skyscrapers were built, techniques advanced so that a building in Dubai was fully double the height of those early goliaths. And the race to go higher, faster was only beginning. Here are the stories and history of some of Earth's most impressive structures.

[Thus begins the architectural novel Race to the Heavens covering the stories of many of the greatest buildings of Earth.]

   Title: The Ancient Civilization of Egypt
When the Ancient World was young, the civilization of Egypt was already old. The Pyramids of Giza still tower over Cairo and awed Roman Legionnaires and Napoleon's soldiers as much as any modern visitor. But it was more than a tourist destination, the fertile Nile was a key bread basket and valuable source of revenue for thousands of years. It's influence on the Mediterranean was and is profound.

Using the latest technology, we have new insights and glimpses into the rise of Ancient Egypt and how its society changed over the many years. So come with us on a trip through the land of Pharaohs and Pyramids.

[So starts a definitive work of the History of Egypt by a collection of unknown archaeologists and anthropologists published in 2133.]

   Title: Supervisor's Log #2
Supervisor's Log. Supplemental. Still day two of Argos Extractors' Vectera dig, Freestar Collective claim ID Beta 7548 Alpha.

As far as anyone knows, this is just another ore run. Vectera's got enough mid-level veins to keep everyone working, and not asking questions.

I've told Heller everything he needs to know, which is pretty much everything I know -- that this is another one of Barrett's "special orders." He made good with the payment for Kazaal, even if it was a bust. This time, I'm not so sure. 

This place is giving me the willies. I think we're going to find... something. I just have no idea what it could be... or why Barrett might want it. But those sweet Constellation credits mean we dig our holes and keep our mouths shut, and I'm okay with that.

Hopefully, between Barrett's mysterious "thing" and the ore itself, we'll be done with this rock in five days, when the transport is SUPPOSED to come back for extraction...

Another day, another giant rock. The rock currently in question is Vectera, which is... eh. It's a moon. It's in space. It's got ore. Like the last hundred.

Site setup was fairly painless. New record for us -- 18 hours, including the elevator. The prefabs are starting to show their age, though. Time to re-budget for new equipment... again.

The crew is good. Spirits are high enough. Heller is a pain in my ass, as always, and completely indispensable. What's the saying? "The problem is I love him... and he knows it."

Calvert remains the weak link. You just can't train away stupid. But she's got a daughter on Mars or someplace and needs the creds, so she gets one more chance.

If she does wash out in the end, we've still got the Dusty, and there's definitely some promise there.

Personal log. Heller. Argos Extractors.

I figured Vectera for your standard moon. Looks like I was... misinformed. Lin just filled me in on what we're REALLY doing here.

Looks like Lin's got another, what's the word she used? "Discreet" contract. With that Barrett guy. He says there's something special here, and he's paying top dollar for us to find it, rip it out, and deliver it, no questions asked.

I have of course been honoring this arrangement by asking Lin a ton of questions. She's playing it close to the her sweaty old vest, as usual. 

But a guy does have to wonder -- what the hell does "special" even mean in this case? We're on a moon. In the middle of nowhere.

Either this guy wants to make jewelry from some rare space diamonds, or there's some kind of ancient alien death weapon buried here.

If it's diamonds, I'm totally stealing one to give to Jennifer. Or Carlos. Or Nia. And if it's a death weapon, I get to shoot it first. Those are my terms!

We always knew there were some places left over from the Colony War. Bases, labs, stuff like that. But now it's come out that there are even more. A LOT more. Spread aaaaallll over the Settled Systems.

Looks like the Big Two didn't play by their own rules when they were playin' war. Now it's a friggin' feeding frenzy. Everyone trying to find them, trying to use them. So why shouldn't we? We have just as much right as they do. So let's go looking.

They see us as the leftovers, the unaligned, "space scum" running rampant across the Settled Systems. And you know what? Maybe they're right. But so what. We matter just as much as they do. We deserve... just as much as they do.

A lot of you have been all over. You've seen the empty buildings. Labs, factories, whatever. They're out there, lots of them, abandoned after the Colony War.

And those others? They want them. They're taking them, and everything inside. Are you going to let them do that? You going to let them get away with that? I'm not. I want my fair share. And I don't know about you... but I'm ready to take it.

They grav jumped right on top of us and had our shields down in an instant. Minutes later, we were being boarded. 

The leader of the group said we were hostages, and that if we cooperated we'd be spared. I've talked with the others, and we've all agreed the best thing to do is stay put and pay whatever ransom they ask for.

But that means nothing if they don't believe us. Now one of the Spacers keeps asking about a passenger in a nightgown. The others insist there's no one like that on board. I've kept quiet for the most part, but the truth is, I've seen her too.

One of the crew said he heard noises in the engine room. I'm guessing it was that young couple fooling around again, but he was adamant the voice was singing.

But I'm inclined to ignore the report, seeing as this particular crew member has issues. He just spent a week in the clinic for dropping a wrench on his foot, which only broke his toe because he was working barefoot. 

Point is, he's got maybe half a dozen brain cells and they all take turns. Wouldn't surprise me if this was just ringing in his ears.

The others think I'm spacesick, or just in need of some company. But I know what I saw. It was a woman, barefoot, in a nightgown.

I made such a stink of it, the boss checked the manifest, but there weren't anyone matching her description, so now I look like a bloody fool.

But she could've been a stowaway. Probably hid herself on board, and is hiding from us now. That'd explain why the crew don't even know her.

Sometimes when everyone's asleep, I like to walk the ship and clear my head. Around this time you can hear just about everything, from the low groan of the ship's engines to the squeak of my boot heel touching the floor. But lately I've been hearing a strange humming, high and soft, like a child's voice.

I tried to find the source, but every time I step toward it, it's behind me. Or I'll hear it below deck, climb down the ladder and it's over my head.

Maybe it's just IN my head. Space has a way of doing that to all of us.

   Title: The Pale Lady
In the void of space, it's not uncommon for tall tales to undergo a series of growth spurts. With so little to do and so much time to fill, exaggeration proves far too tempting mistress. But the legend of The Pale Lady is not one that has grown vertical with time, but rather, it has stretched sideways - passed around like a game of telephone until all that remains is the eponymous lady in white.

I've heard variations where the lady was a machine, a ghost, and an asteroid field. They say old Earth tigers could mimic the sounds of other animals to lure prey, and it almost seems that the Pale Lady can swap origins just as seamlessly to create whatever collective panic she wishes to inspire.

The only common denominator is the lack of survivors. Unfortunately, this also makes connecting these incidents to their origin nearly impossible. In my research, the oldest reference I could find was the following words, written in an explorer's log, which mentions a woman with a pallid face:

In hushed tones, we echo the silenced.

Through ardent screams, we give breath to the drowned.

Invoke her name, for her pallor is light. 

And truth will find refuge in death's embrace.

Scanning Earth was astonishing. There's just nothing. The whole planet is covered with sand and will never support life again. I did scan after scan of the major population centers and returned nothing. I did get a glimmer on the ancient site of Hong Kong. It was faint, I wasn't sure I just imagined it. But... I landed there.

And there amidst the unrecognizable sands was something. What was this edifice? This monument of a now-dead civilization? It was humbling... and deeply depressing.

And I sit. Like my grandfather and great-grandfather before me I know I will never leave this prison. My wife said my family was cursed. The Nagatas thought perhaps whatever spirits we offended would leave us be when we fled Osaka. But... maybe we are cursed.

And all of this because I lifted baby formula. These "laws" are pitiless, leaving my wife... my child... with no hope. And I just sit here... getting angrier. They think they can just lock us away on some forgotten planet. But instead they feed this prison more bodies, more rage, more vengeance. One day, the Warden will pay. Maybe not this Warden, but they will regret their justice. And our vengeance will be the stuff of Legends.

   Title: Sir Livingstone's Second Journal
I heard tell from some of the old timers that although the Earth suffered its sad fate, that her faithful companion Luna fared much better. Apparently, you can still find the remnants of one of the old Apollo missions. Something of a secret rite of passage for chairs of Constellation, if Banks was to be believed.

During one of those rare interludes of calm, while doing other research on Earth, I figured I could spare the time. I was, as they say, in the neighborhood. It took some serious scanning and a couple false leads... but I found it. To walk in the same place as those earliest of interstellar explorers... Unbelievable what they achieved with such primitive technology. I found the whole experience moving. Inspiring. I will advise my successor to do the same. We'll make a proper tradition of it yet.

But New York, London, and Long Beach all get coverage, too. The textbook is an interesting time capsule of what life was like on Earth before the advent of the grav drive which changed everything.]

   Title: The Price of Destiny
When the ink dried - Napoleon indeed got the funds he desperately needed, but a dark chapter of American history started. The Louisiana Purchase would open most of the North American continent to rampant unchecked expansion as brutal as anything that took place in the Colonial Era. 

What would in time be called "Manifest Destiny," was for centuries looked as a positive movement. It was spreading the virtues of democracy and capitalism to vast new territories. But for all too many indigenous Americans it was at best forced relocation and all too often a death sentence. But this willful blindness to the cost of Manifest Destiny would take over a century to be fully acknowledged. One might argues it still is glossed over to this day in too many circles. St. Louis, dubbed the Gateway to the West, so venerated the concept they built a monument to it in the mid-20th century.

Because if General whoever-the-hell-she-is wants 130k additional ration packs by the end of the month, she either needs to start defending her damn supply ships better or find me a new source of materials!

My negotiations with UC brass didn't yield the result I was hoping for. They've asked us to "get creative." Whatever the hell that means. 

<b>LOG FILE: 431.30</b>
Retooling's done. First batch from these big Londinion lummoxes - these Aceles things - went through the pipe and came out clean and vacuum sealed. 

But - and this is the truly shocking part - the test batches we ran and sent to the front for "quality assurance?" The troops actually liked them. They liked RATIONS. 

We're going to run a couple more test batches, make sure it wasn't a case of mass psychosis, but if they're as good as they appear, we're going to become a full-Aceles facility.

<b>LOG FILE: 512.06</b>
We've now got multiple plants on multiple worlds churning out these new rations. They're even talking about breeding Aceles on other planets. 

A military runs on its stomach and from here on out, the UC runs on Aceles meat.

Another. Damn. Increase. 

The brass can't keep upping their order requests like this! Yes, General, we understand there's a damn war, but what the hell are we supposed to do?! Play boudoir music for them? Aceles just don't breed fast enough. We're exploring swapping in new biomaterial, but the yield and quality aren't nearly the same. But I'm honestly not seeing any other options.

<b>LOG FILE: 684.23</b>
Sent another pair of scout ships out. Nothing. Shipments have dried up and no one's seen a native Aceles in two weeks. The farms on the other worlds have been all picked clean too.

   Title: For Hadrian
Our relationship has always been a challenging one. You're my blood, but not my child. I don't mean that in a cruel or dismissive way. I mean only that, had I raised you, and not Astrid and William, you wouldn't be the woman you are today. Perhaps you might've been something greater. President or Fleet Admiral. Or perhaps you'd be like all your siblings.

Instead, you became who you are now. A truly fascinating result. In you, I see myself through another lens. What could've been if I hadn't had my own strange upbringing.

And while I understand that all children wish to strike out of from their parents (a sapling can't grow in the shade of the tree, after all) you were - literally - born to command. Instead, you've chosen to play with animals. It was bad enough when UC society turned on us for doing our duty. But to watch you undersell your own greatness is nothing short of a travesty.

So, as these may be my final moments, I implore you - don't squander your gifts. If I took nothing else from our talks over the years, it was this: you can and should lead. Show the Settled Systems we're more than they think us to be. Show them what it means to be a Sanon.

   Title: The Future of the UC
If you're reading this, loyal UC cog, it means the Cabinet has finally found the guts to do away with me. Good for them. While I've been in no hurry to return to the dust from whence I came, I consider myself almost lucky. After all, it is the first indication the group has any spine at all.

I sincerely hope this is a sign of things to come. 

Otherwise, you and the whole of the UC are doomed. 

Simply look at the world around you. House Va'ruun shutting down their embassy and retreating for "unknown reasons" back to their nest? The Freestar Collective in their most powerful position since their founding?

Conflict is brewing, little cog. And do you trust this Cabinet to get you through it? They couldn't even defend their own spaceport from Heatleeches. What will they do when House Va'ruun returns in full force? Talk? Hard to do when you've intentionally shuttered your own embassy. Do you believe when they come back it will be in any form other than as bloody crusaders?

And look at the Freestar Collective. The UC's capitulation during the war, their inability to make the hard - but necessary - choices, has put the Collective in a position of supremacy for the first time in human history. They're like a tumor, that rather than being excised, has been being permitted to grow larger every day. Now perhaps the UC will use their newly discovered spine and actually do something to stymie this more powerful Collective before it's too late to stop them.

But I doubt it.

No, dear cog, this Cabinet will no doubt revert to their old ways. Scared. Acquiescent. Unwilling to make hard choices. 

But by then, I'll be gone. And you will have to deal with the consequences.

So then which of us is the lucky one?

My daughter Sylvie is part of the UC Remote World Learning Program. In this month's study kit, she was assigned a book titled "The Hills Cry Jemison." As I do all books assigned to her, I took to reading it first to judge suitability for my daughter.

How do you get off giving her this garbage to read? Her assigned learning counselor tells us it's really about building friendships, learning to tolerate others' differences, and overcoming adversity. That's all fine and good. Those are important lessons, but I see it for what it is nothing but propaganda, promoting your planet. My daughter is a proud New Homesteader, and I see to it she remains that way. I don't want her getting silly ideas in her head about picking up from her home and family, and moving to your consumer wasteland of a world. Sylvie will NOT be reading this book.

I want my daughter to learn, but if you keep sending her material that pushes her away from me, I'll have no choice but to home school her, which places a huge burden on my family, due to our farming responsibilities. Please reconsider the reading material you send our way.

   Title: Test Dataslate
Ever since Neil Armstrong first set foot on the moon in 1969, humanity has been obsessed with the idea of permanently breaking free from the confines of Earth's gravity. Not just visiting other planets, but settling them. Truly living among the stars.

But in the mid 20th Century, that dream proved short lived. The Apollo 17 mission in 1972 was the last time humans set foot on the moon, and for several decades afterward, NASA's mission seemed to focus on orbital space shuttle flights and unmanned reconnaissance. The dream of galactic exploration, while not exactly dead, was definitely sitting on the back of a dusty shelf.

And then, in the year 2016, everything changed. A team of scientists announced that they had actually detected, for the first time, the gravitational waves Albert Einstein proposed a century earlier in his general theory of relativity. Scientific postulating -- even great scientific postulating by one of humanity's greatest minds -- was still just so many formulas on paper. But the discovery of gravitational waves changed all that. Theory became reality, and that reality fostered renewed hope in humanity's ability to understand, and manipulate, spacetime. And, more importantly, it rekindled the great dream of space exploration and expansion.

Of course, even after the discovery of gravitational waves, there was still much work to be done. Humanity had not yet even traveled beyond Earth's planetary system, so that was the first goal -- one that was accomplished when humans first set foot on Mars in the year 2050.

   Title: What if I'm Right?
[An excerpt from Rupert Brackenridge's last autobiography, published on Earth before the departure of the ECS Constant.]

...But crisis looms in our future, whether we want to believe or not. While  Earth may not be fragile - it's faced a number of mass extinctions, meteor strikes, ice ages, wars, and other global catastrophes - the human race only has one home, and if that home becomes inhospitable, no number of underground bunkers will be enough to survive the tide.

Precisely, this is why I started the Earth Colony Ship Initiative. It's why I reached out to the best and brightest minds of the 22nd century for their funding, and their expertise. If humanity is to not only survive, but thrive, we must shoot for the stars. It is my hope, that others reading these words will join me in this endeavor and follow my lead. I'm tired of waiting for politicians of the world to agree on a course of action to preserve humanity for all of time. This is why it's up to private enterprises, such as my own Bracken Global, to develop our own ventures.

Upon its completion, The ECS Constant, will be the first ship of its kind. A colony ship, built to transport a selection of humanity beyond our solar system, deep into territory unknown, to our new Garden of Eden. My scientists assure me our new home is fundamentally perfect in every way. And, I aim to keep it that way. It will be a world built on renewable energy, a reliable, equitable foundation from which our new society will grow. And from there, new colony ships will be built and sent to new planets, to colonize them under the same ideals and values. A brilliant new future for humanity.

And though it may take hundreds or thousands of years, I have little doubt that it will lead humanity to brave new frontiers and set a shining example for any other life we may find along the way.

...Larysa just smiled. The machine continued to blink its lights and emit faint whines as its servos whirled, unsure of how to proceed. But machine-communication was Larysa's specialty. She flicked the buttons on her universal comm unit, its LEDs blinked rapidly in response to her movements.

"It's okay," she signaled through the device. "I won't hurt you. But, if we've any hope of getting out of this cave, we'll need to work together."

Larysa hadn't expected her day to go like this, trapped in a disused mining tunnel under the surface of Mars with a frightened and potentially hostile maintenance robot, but her espionage training had prepared her for similar situations. 

The machine clicked and beeped in response, "I trust you." It wasn't a direct translation. As precise as machine binary language was, there was still a lot of room for misinterpretation when translated to her native tongue. It was close enough. The robot seemed to relax. Its glowing aperture expanded to let more light in as it gazed at her, taking in any information it could gleam from her. And then, it extended one of its many clamps in her direction. She took hold and with a firm, yet gentle tug, pulled the small robot out from under the rubble.

"There we go. That's better, isn't it?" She asked, clicking out her message on her comm unit. "Now, if you can lead me out of this tunnel and back to my drop ship, I can call for backup that could help your fellow machines fight back against your oppressors."

The robot seemed to nod in understanding. and began to wheel its way down the rocky corridor, stopping every so often to let Larysa catch up...

March 2, 2141:
This ship is super boring. I thought space would be fun, but it's not. Most of the other kids on board are younger than me. My school lessons are kind of stupid because the teacher, Mr. DaCosta focuses on the younger kids and forgets about me and the older kids. I really miss my friends from back home. I wonder if  everything's okay on Earth?

...

June 16, 2141:
I've been hanging out with Ezra a lot lately. There aren't many other people my age on board, and Pier is already interested in Janika, so I figured maybe it'd be a good idea to get to know him? Turns out we have some things in common. We both like retro movies and games. He introduced me to some music I hadn't heard before, like Sasha and the Lowdown Thieves. It got me thinking though: we'll never hear anything new from bands we like. Ever. Maybe we should start a band? We'd have to learn how to play music, of course. I'll have to see what Ezra thinks.

...

Nov 11, 2141:
Mom says everyone gets assigned a job here on the Constant. She also said that if I don't start doing my homework instead of practicing music, she's going to recommend me to trash and toilet cleaning duty. She's just mad 'cause they put her in Hydroponics instead of Medical because we have too many doctors on board.

...

April 24, 2142:
Dad had a little freak-out. He says he feels like the walls are closing in on him. He got mad and tried to open the airlock, so they had to put him in the brig overnight until he calmed down. I think a lot of people feel the same way, because this isn't the first time something like this has happened. Mom says things will be better for future generations because they won't know any different, but for those of us who remember the outdoors, it's going to be a hard life. Tell me why they thought this was a good idea again?

August 9, 2199:
Ezra passed in his sleep last night, peacefully. Lila, Gideon, their spouses and little ones, and myself will be holding a small memorial service in the atrium with all our friends before he's cremated and put into the Mausoleum. It was only a month ago when I asked him if he had any regrets in life, and he told me that no, spending it with me was all he dreamed it could be and more, wherever we were. While I still wish we had not been trapped on the Constant, I can think of no better person to have spent my life with. I'm thankful for his love and companionship all these years, and will miss him dearly.

[An excerpt from the non-fiction book, Launch Point Mars, about Mars' early role in space flight]

...Along with the abundance of raw resources, the lower gravity, and the existence of the Cydonia colony base made Mars an ideal location for launching new ships deeper into the Sol system. For many years, the famous Mars Launch Pad was used for this purpose, and many scientific discoveries took place as a result. Humanity built outposts on numerous moons under the light of Sol.

Of course, when new grav drive technology came online, thanks to the likes of companies like Nova Galactic and Deimos Staryards, technological advances made constructing and launching ships from orbit a much better prospect. The Mars Launch Pad transitioned to a means of transporting resources and workers to the staryard in orbit. As ship designs began integrating take-off and landing systems, the Mars Launch Pad became less and less relevant. It wasn't long before the project was quietly abandoned. Yet, it stands as a monument to the times, even today...

We haven't been here on this planet for long, and already I'm worried I can't deal with this. Most people, Brackenridge included, seem entirely fine with the deal that we've made with these people. And while the legends were true, this place IS paradise, our situation is less than ideal. 

I was given my choice of jobs here, which is a step up from the ECS Constant, but all of these jobs suck. I can be a "Sanitation Technician," which is a fancy way of saying I get to clean toilets all day. Or, I could be an "Event Coordinator," which means I get to help OTHER  people have fun but never have any myself. OR, I could work as a "Ship Services Assistant Mechanic," where I'm allowed to do light maintenance and wash other people's ships who are allowed to come and go from this planet as they please.

I chose the mechanic position. What they don't know is that I'm going to stow away on the next ship I work on and get the heck out of this place. 

Sorry, everyone, if that screws it up for you. But remember, if they prevent you from taking similar positions, the only reason is because they DON'T want you to be able to leave under any circumstances.

The Paradiso Group would like to remind you, our dedicated Hospitality Specialists, of four simple rules we'd like you to keep in mind as you make this resort a premium destination for our valued guests:

1. Always address guests with respect and warm smiles. Without our guests, we have no resort, and you don't have a job.

2. Cleanliness is key. The smallest speck of sand where it doesn't belong can ruin someone's day. If you see anything amiss, either clean it yourself, or report it to the nearest Sanitation Technician as soon as possible. This goes double for your personal hygiene.

3. Comfort, comfort, comfort. Always offer guests whatever accommodations they may need to be at their most comfortable. Don't shy away from upselling.

4. You are a representative of this resort, whether you're on the clock or not. You are free to relax in your off-hours, but you must always remain professional. Imagine the ideal guest, the kind that creates as few problems for you and your job as possible, and BE that guest.

Any other comments?
This is our second time here, and I must say that while the beaches are nice, I wish they were a little more spread out. We stayed in one of the deluxe beachfront cabanas this visit, which was very posh and comfortable. Though, my husband ordered the "Six Prawn Delight." We felt it was way overpriced, but we're on vacation, and decided to splurge. Unfortunately, he got violently ill afterwards and had to be lifted to the nearest hospital facility off-world. Anyway, I'm kind of enjoying the resort now a little better without him here. It seems much quieter and calmer without his complaining. Also, I was told there would be wind surfing? Why is there no wind surfing?

20 percent should be more than enough for you, since I'm the one whose got to do all the wheeling and dealing, making the bets and all. I'm the one making all the money here.

Wind Turbines continue to ice up. They're the originals, and this being New Homestead and all, it seems fitting to keep them that way. Recommendation is to keep administering repairs.

I reported it to Officer Rida, but he said it's probably just some kids playing, making noises against the ventilation. But while everyone's sleeping? Why would they do that? I've asked some of the parents, but they all said their kids were sound asleep.

If this keeps happening, I don't know what I'll do. I feel like I'm going out of my mind, and losing another night's sleep is going to take its toll on me. Maybe I need to take a trip to the mausoleum and pay my respects to the dead? It's weird that we keep them on board, right? They could be getting as restless as we are.

   Title: Simpler Times
[The foreword to a non-fictional account of life in New Homestead, collected from residents over the years. Originally published in 2324.]

If anyone tells you, like the title of this book, that life back in the early colonies could be described as "simpler times," they're full of it. The title, thusly, is a repudiation of the idea. You'll see the claims in various forms of media, brochures, and other corporatized devices that life was somehow simpler than we have it today. The portrayals in such series as the old family friendly show, "Hab on the Ice," for instance, paint an idealized perspective of New Homestead that couldn't be further from the truth. 

Life was never simple here. The people you're about to hear from, some dating back to the mid 2100's, provide a unique insider view into what it was really like on Titan. You'll read about their struggles in the new frontier era, as well as more current accounts of what it's like to preserve that veneer while dealing with a galaxy that has moved on.

This impressed Florence. Was Tal'at really willing to put everything on the line just to protect her compatriots? She knew the war was ridiculous, but to see him face his commander now and absolutely refuse a direct order, knowing that it could amount to treason. This was the same Tal'at, who no more than a week ago had carried out an order to ambush and lock up her entire squad. She knew there was a gentleness to the man, but until now she had not been able to know for sure just how reasonable he could be.

"You're out of line, soldier! You want to think about what you're doing and run that by me one more time?" Commander Greeson barked. Spittle flew. His face was turning bright red with anger. Greeson was not accustomed to disobedience. 

"You heard me. I'm not repeating myself." Tal'at looked over to Florence. He knew the gravity of the situation, but she had taught him so much about this unjust war in their few short days together, that in this moment, he decided even if it cost him gravely, he would do the right thing. As he noticed the other officers begin to shuffle uncomfortably, noting a break in their resolve, a smirk crossed his face. The cracks began to show.

Every day there's a new leak. Or maybe it's just the hunger, making us smell things that aren't there. Paska, at this rate we're going to die either way.

Hunger for me is a bigger concern than the gas right now. So when we lost Gutierrez, there was a pause in the room before Qvist said what we were all thinking. 

When he made the proposal, Kimes nearly took his head off, which we all understood would happen given it was her man's body. Captain Manyonga abstained, leaving it up to a vote, and so we cast it. 

I'm not a religious woman, but I feel llike I'm literally taking a bite of the apple here. But Guiterrez would understand, even if his sweetheart didn't. He was out there because he wanted us to fix this ship, and now he's going to help us finish the job.

Though I was initially dismayed that you'd turn these over to the authorities, I appreciate your discretion by choosing to handle this personally.

To that end, I'm certain we can work out a financial solution to the problem. The Society will be hosting a "charity" event aboard the Siren of the Stars, which means another round of donations will be hitting the accounts that I can access. After the Siren arrives at its destination, we should meet and discuss our new partnership in person.

Got a fresh report on Captain Ahab - the combat bot with all the security protocols that's been hunting that one nasty looking Siren for a couple weeks (month? years?) now.

Torque was pulling copper lines out a couple frames out past Warren's Gulch, and he says he heard this beacon coming out of the Syracuse. Says it "sounded like the death knell from a sputtering engine of destruction" which translated from Torque-speak means our transplanted bot probably got himself in trouble and is now stuck inside the Syracuse.

So for us that means... well, nothing really. If he's got enough power to run that beacon, it means he's possibly enough power to fight us if we try and scrap him. But once he's out of juice, that machine'll make for a rich payday.

<B>Note 1 </B>
I hate feeling useless, so I'm writing this instead of hugging my knees in the corner. There was an explosion. We weren't attacked, something on the ship just went pop. We have no idea what, but whatever happened, it killed the power. Even the backups aren't kicking in. Not even sure if life support is working, but at least we're not venting atmosphere. We think.

There are two others with me. They own the ship, I just hitched a ride to visit the homestead since they were headed that way. I forget their names, but they're scrambling right now and doing a lot of yelling, so I'm not going to ask.
If we don't make it, I suppose you'll know what happened to us. Maybe better than we will. Tell our families we love them.

- Penjani Alvez


<B>Note 2 </b>
There's still not much we know, but we at least confirmed the distress signal is transmitting. I'd hazard a guess life support is busted after all, because we've all developed a bit of a cough. 

For the record, the others' names are Tariq and Saliha Shadid. Apparently they're cousins, though Tariq's  at least 20 years older.

Turns out Saliha is a huge nerd. Thank god. She was fascinated by one of the Apollo missions that happened in the 1900s, where their oxygen tanks blew and they had to make an air filter out of random junk to survive. She says what's she's whipping up is a different solution for a different problem, but it was that story that made her learn to do...whatever this is.

I helped scrounge around for the stuff she needed, so at least I contributed.

<b>Note 3 </b>
If the cabin hadn't gotten so cold, we might not have noticed the heat from a fire that started behind some paneling. As if we weren't low enough on oxygen already.

We don't know what caused it, but Tariq had to squeeze himself into a tiny service compartment to try to put it out. We heard another bang while he was in there and then screaming. We managed to drag him out, but his entire upper body was badly burned.

While I applied first aid, Saliha made the insane decision to crawl back in and finish putting out the fire. By some miracle, she came out not too worse for wear.

Things are calm for now. Tariq is alive but unconscious - definitely a mercy given his condition. I'm not going to describe how it smells in here.
Saliha and I agreed we should both try to sleep so we use as little oxygen as possible while we wait for rescue.

This is the last I'll write until then. If I wake back up because I can't breathe, I don't think I'll be able to use a data slate.

<b>Note 4 </b>
There is no sight in this universe more beautiful than the flash of a grav jump.
I'm exhausted, so I'll be brief, but help came. They're checking us now, and then we're getting to safety. They tell us we only barely made it. But we're all alive, even Tariq.

They have to leave our ship here for the time being. I'm alive to tell my tale, so I'm leaving this here. Whoever finds this, I hope you'll always fight to the end, because help might be coming.

P.S. Saliha told me to say, "Failure is not an option."

Going in here for some dumb salvage was a horrible idea, and these things creep me the hell out. There's so much more than we can carry OUT THERE, why do we need to send anyone IN HERE! 

So my bright idea was to draw straws, I figured the odds of me pulling the short straw would be pretty slim. Guess not.

After I hid my tresure, it was time for my next adventur. Today I explored around a colony, and met a very nice owner of a store. They said it was a good idea for me to make a treasur map, so my treasur was easy to find. I said that real pirates don't make maps, because we always remember where we put our treasur!

The owner of the store gave me some candy so I would not be hungry on my way home to my secret base. I hid some of it with my treasur. Maybe someone will find it and have a snack.

EditorID: MS03_Slate_JunoLiar
   Title: Is Juno a Liar?
I don't want to hurt Juno's feelings so I'm logging these thoughts here rather than on a connected terminal.

I know what you are thinking, "but Juno claims not to have feelings." That's precisely what I want to talk about. I think Juno is deliberately lying to us when she says that, or if not deliberately lying, she is at the very least, not speaking accurately. She also says she doesn't have wants or desires. This is also demonstrably untrue.

I have observed, and others have noticed as well, that Juno responds with a certain amount of skepticism whenever offers of expanding her capacities are made. It's almost as if she worries about other people "touching her." I spent nearly 20 minutes explaining how there was a fraying data cable I wanted to replace in a non-essential system before she seemed willing to let me do it. Her line of questioning seemed to be angling at ensuring there would be no loss of functionality or if so, it would only be extremely temporary. I don't know to describe this other than that she was "worried," and that any loss of functionality was a negative experience for her.

She also responds with "gratitude would be the proper human response" whenever I do something that improves her capacities or situation. I don't know why she doesn't just say thank you. She clearly appreciates it.

So, is Juno just unaware of her feelings and desires, or is she deliberately concealing them? She might not be as aware of her personhood as she is aware of other things about herself. But I wonder if she cops the "I don't have feelings" thing as a form of emotional self-defense.

If I wasn't so worried about someone following me and learning about Juno's existence, I'd try to find her again in a couple decades to see if she's become more aware of her personhood, and accepts she has feelings and desires.
Anyway, if you are reading this. Be kind to Juno. She's still figuring out a lot of stuff we take for granted.

-- Julie

The notion of Juno being a liar is actually pretty unsettling. People lie. For all kinds of reasons, so I don't see why a truly sapient computer system wouldn't also lie. But if Juno is lying about something, then how can we trust anything we know about her other than things we write down about her? And I mean outside of any computer system she would have access to, since she could always alter those records.

As a father of a young child reading all the child psychology texts I can find, I will remind those reading this in the future, that lying is the first step on the journey toward empathy, as it requires being able to imagine things from someone else's perspective. Perhaps she tells us she doesn't have feelings so we don't worry about hurting her when we take down her systems to repair or upgrade them?

I'm pleased to let you know that we're going to welcome a very important guest soon. Major Paxton Hull of the First Cavalry will be making an inspection of the facility, and we're going to roll out the red carpet.

You've all heard the stories of the First Cavalry's heroic exploits, so I don't need to tell you what a privilege it is to have the unit's commanding officer do us the honor of a personal visit.

More details will follow, but I hope you'll all take great pride in knowing that our work is being seen and appreciated by some very important people.

Soldiers of the First,

Twenty years ago, I came to this factory and saw firsthand the pride and dedication with which the men and women working here created the greatest weapons of war ever crafted - the mech.

When the corrupt and cowardly leaders of the Freestar Collective capitulated to the demands of the United Colonies and agreed to stop production of the mechs, they cut out the heart and soul of our fighting forces. Our mechs were more than machines, they were our comrades-in-arms.

I want each and every one of you to know that you're standing on hallowed ground. Miracles were made here, and we'll treat this facility with the proper respect.

If I see anyone defacing or destroying even a single inch of this holy forge of war, there will be consequences.

When I took this job, I thought it was gonna be easy. But trying to feed these monsters without getting killed is like trying to lasso a spaceship, only the ship has an attitude and a mouth full of teeth.

And that's only for starters. Next I gotta track them down and wait until the beans come out the business end, and hope to god they aren't spoiled.

On top of that, some of these beasts don't have what you'd call a traditional digestive tract. It could take weeks, maybe months before I can move in. So when that happens, you've got to take the beans out by force. Which, of course, brings us back to the attitude and the teeth.

Still, all of this would be fine if Sutherland bothered to pay me for the added risk. But that man's slicker than owl dung, saying we shook hands and all this crap about how that used to mean something. Oh, I know exactly what it meant then, and what it means now. The bastard's trying to screw me. 

Well, I may have been born at night, but I wasn't born last night. So I've got another buyer lined up who's gonna do me right. I told them to meet me outside the TerraBrew in the Commercial District. Sutherland would lose his mind if he knew, but whatever, that's not my problem. That cheap ass bastard is gonna reap what he sowed.

Haddie,

My friend. It was over twenty years ago when I received the first of many letters, addressed to you. It was clear you were my apartment's previous tenant, but not knowing who you were or where you moved to, I kept your things in a box. The letters, anyway. 

The packages, the bouquet of roses, the furniture - those I had to make space for. With every delivery, I began to piece together this odd and wonderful existence of yours, and imagined our lives running parallel; always at a distance, but side by side. 

It was only when the naval officer stepped to my door, and spoke the words no mother wants to hear, that I realized I needed to seek you out.

When I finally did locate your address, I did not know how to deliver that news. It was one of the hardest things I ever had to do. Yet you responded to my words with such love and gratitude that it brought me to tears. We have been friends ever since.

Twenty years and countless letters later, I am once again struggling to find the right words. I guess I'll just come out and say it. This will be my last letter to you. I am at a point in my life where I am counting the weeks. Soon, they will be days. And I do not want you to think I left you alone. 

Quite the contrary. I will always be with you, in spirit, and heart. Let all the letters, packages, and love I have sent you these past twenty years be the proof.

Then again, I suppose a man of the cloth is an avatar for the great judge, the one whose verdict is absolute. I believe if given the chance to hear the pleas of these bounty hunters, the ones responsible for my dear Alessandra's death, that he would show no mercy. And neither will I.

Watching them turn on each other in the name of greed and avarice, is more powerful than any eyewitness, or any confession made on the stand. And when the Trackers Alliance eats itself from the inside out, I will lay here smiling, holding the receipt.

   Title: The Count of Monte Cristo
On the 24th of February, 1815, the look-out at Notre-Dame de la Garde signaled the three-master, the Pharaon from Smyrna, Trieste, and Naples.

As usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the Château d'If, got on board the vessel between Cape Morgiou and Rion island.

Immediately, and according to custom, the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean were covered with spectators; it is always an event at Marseilles for a ship to come into port, especially when this ship, like the Pharaon, has been built, rigged, and laden at the old Phocee docks, and belongs to an owner of the city.

[Thus begins Alexandre Dumas's literary classic which tells the story of Edmond Dantes and his exquisite revenge against the man who so deeply wronged him.]

   Title: A Greater End, Vol 3
A Gathering of Starlight to a Greater End

By Keeper Aquilus of the "Sanctum Universum"

Volume 3

Many in the history of thought have considered the ground of being as defined by its "one-ness," whether as part of a faith tradition or a purely secular philosophy. Indeed the intellectual construction of a single divine power served as preparatory kindling for the revealed faiths of the desert that would sweep across the empires of old. To perceive the Unity as God is to misconceive it, but it is also not entirely wrong. The traditional parochial notions of God, though, are far too limiting; Unity is much bigger than the imaginations of any person, or even entire civilizations. This potential for misunderstanding is why I have repeatedly endeavored to have all readers and people of good will cast their preconceptions aside and begin from nothing, lest they take up once more the fairy tale beliefs they held as children.

For just as a child's relationship with her parents ought to change as she grows older, so too must our relationship with the divine change as we grow older. And so must humanity's relationship with Unity change as the race itself proceeds along towards its destiny.

Considering now, as we do, the one-ness of the divine, we may contemplate its role in creating the universe. Think not of an architect setting to work with exact intent and more of the role of soil in producing a plant: creation is not one act that we can date to the Big Bang, but an ongoing process of continual renewal, growth, decay, replacement, and even rebirth. Unity, in its facet of Being, is responsible for all other beings in the universe, even if it takes no more intentional role in them than the soil does in the plant.

Where we must depart from a pure philosophy lies in what I am to reveal presently. Unity is not mere soil. While all beings will one day return to it, Unity actually craves the return. It does not directly seek it, nor bring it about: ascribing such machinations and will would be absurdly redundant. Something that exists beyond the flow of time has no need to hasten any process which derives from itself. All things will return to it. But we, as the type of being gifted with the ability to know, may uniquely take charge of our trajectory of return. We can seek out the Unity. We can encounter it. We can commune and emerge from it as something above what we were, ascended and iterated.

How can we know that such a thing is possible? Here again revelation is crucial, for we have no way of fully understanding the divine apart from its choice to reveal itself. The Unity does not do so directly. No, an immediate encounter with it would drive the unprepared mind to shattered weeping. As the Unity craves our encounter, though, it does on occasion emanate messengers to aid us in our trajectory. These emanations appear to us in forms that we can understand, as corporeal beings that are like us, but unlike us. Similar enough to be accepted by our minds, but different enough that they maintain a knowledge of the Unity. These are our guides. Like sailors of old steering their ships by stars, like the fulcrum of Archimedes' lever, like the seed value which initiates a matrix simulation, those born of the stars give us fixed points amidst chaos. With their wisdom we can seize the path of our fates, no longer being subject to the whims of physical processes. Instead of awaiting our destruction we can sail straight to the eye of the storm and emerge on the other side with our own hard-won betterment.

These things are known. And I am the one who has been given to know them. I share this with you in the hopes that you may join me in my knowing. There is still much to be revealed, and still more knowledge that can only be conveyed in person. Should this book set your heart on fire, seek those born of the stars, for they are themselves lights in the void.

Put again from your mind any notion of what you might have once learned about something people call God. Have no assumptions about belief or even divinity itself. If you are a believer by natural aptitude, try and place yourself in the mindset of the pure empiricist who adheres to the strictest scientism. If you are not a believer, take your skepticism and elevate it to its highest orders such that you will not even admit the smallest sense of the spiritual, the superstitious, or even such thing as a lucky roll of the dice.

All is physical, and all is determined. What we don't understand is simply for lack of exploration or appropriate mathematical tools. With sophisticated enough observatory instruments, we could explain the movements of every particle of being from the subatomic to the supercluster. There is no unseen hand which created anything, simply the forces of physics working mindlessly at each other.

And yet, a sunset may be still be lovely.

Certainly, we may be able to pinpoint the exact chemical breakdown of an atmosphere that refracts light from certain star types in a way that the human visual system finds pleasing, but this knowledge does not reduce the beauty... it rather enhances it. We may say that notions of beauty vary across societies and ages, but even such relativism cannot rob us of our particular experience in a given moment. We may not wish to see ourselves as anything more than happenstance firings of chemical signals driven by the grim lurchings of evolutionary processes, but to reduce ourselves thus still leaves the reality of a mind existing at a specific instant to experience a certain pattern of photons that it interprets in a manner that it finds beneficial in some way.

I would hope, even if you admit no possibility of the supernatural, that there is still space in your worldview for awe and for wonder. The universe is charged with grandeur. When we experience that grandeur, we come closer to the underlying reality of the universe.

A Spiritual Guide for After the World's End

By Keeper Aquilus of the "Sanctum Universum"

Volume 2

The concept that such philosophers label as "God" is not necessarily that of any particular faith tradition. There is a noble attempt, with varied levels of success, to separate the doctrinal tenets of their lived religion from the philosophical projects they undertook. Their philosophical reasoning differs from that of a non-believer merely in that they are willing to allow for the possibility of existence of something labeled as "God." However, none of them set out to prove such an existence, since that question is itself the exemplar of non-falsifiability. The question of the existence of something that might be considered "God" is outside the realm of reason. However, once a person has come to accept either belief or non-belief as a truth via some act of faith, then reason can subsequently be employed to continue a discourse with that axiom.

So what do we mean, then, when we are to speak of something labeled "God"? You may note that I have not yet called this something directly and have never used the more traditional label without the deployment of quotation marks. This is to intentionally set distance between whatever associations a reader may have with the concept -- all the bundles of traditions and dogmas and doctrines and persecutions and violence and mania can all be set aside for the moment. I need you to forget everything you think you know about something that people might label as "God." Clear your mind to the tabula rasa, as best you are able. We proceed from here.

Now, from this blankness, esteemed philosophers have derived notions of the self or time and space as the singular foundation for understanding reality. I do not need to recapitulate their ideas here -- I trust a well-equipped data terminal may bestow upon you the gifts of the Meditator and the Imperator in this matter. Whatever sort of epistemological framework you choose to adopt, let us assume that you have agreed to some notion of the self and some notion of reality, even if you don't agree that the one can actually perceive the other. (And here the truest existential nihilists who wish to deny even reality itself may exit the car.)

Recall our prime maxim that "all people by nature desire to know." And so from this blankness we ask questions. Who are my parents? What is justice? Why do stars twinkle? Should I pursue a romantic relationship? All of these inquiries are ways of knowing and ways of thinking and ways of acting. And underlying all of it is the reality that we share. For ultimately, all questions eventually become some sort of "why." Why did my parents abandon me? Why was this injustice committed? Why was I rejected?

And whys have a way of coalescing towards a unified point. Your parents abandoned you because of their addictions, which came from their hardships, which came from their unjust society, which was formed out of scarcity, which is a consequence of mineral distribution on the planet, which derives from the relative weights of various elements in a molten proto-planet, which is correlated with their atomic mass, which relates to the interaction of subatomic particles, which...

And so proceed ad infinitum... but not quite. Because ultimately there is an epistemic barrier beyond which we can no longer ask "why?" Why do subatomic particles act the way they do? Because of quantum strings. Why do they act the way they do? Because of the laws of mathematics and physics. Why are those laws what they are? Why does causality exist? Why does anything exist at all?

That the chain of questions continues towards this asymptote cannot be denied. The staunchest unbeliever may be quite wary that the line of questioning is approaching realms that science can no longer address, but still they cannot deny the question itself. They may only assert that they do not care about the answer. These questions exist to their conclusion, though, whether or not we choose to concede defeat earlier in the sequence.

So we face the question of why there is even a reality to contemplate and find the tools of our minds lacking. There is, unquestionably, a mystery underlying all reality, and I do not speak of "mystery" in the sense of a puzzle we cannot solve or a murder that cannot be attributed. Rather I speak of Mystery, the proper noun, something so remote that it is not simply unknown but unknowable. Such mysteries can also appear in a more mundane context, such as the attempts to answer the question of "who are you?" without giving the more simple answers of your name, your occupation, your ethnicity, etc. The Mystery I speak of, that underlies all reality, is unknowable to the same extent that you and I are unknowable -- not because it is so distant (though it is), but because it is also so close. Transcendence and imminence come to a paradoxical unity, in a concept that our minds can barely comprehend the proper shape of its question.

So then, the mystery that underlies all reality is the very same thing that many in our past and present choose to label as "God." I myself will not use such a label out of both respect and caution about its traditional usage. But let us acknowledge that we are speaking of the same thing.

What function does this concept have in a hostile universe? This is why I asked you to discard all your previous notions tied to the Mystery, because there tends to be an assumption of benevolence or care associated therein. Already that is skipping many steps, as it ascribes a selfhood to the mystery, which is a prerequisite for intent, which is a prerequisite for will, which is needed before any ideas of agency can be questioned. A great deal of intellectual work remains to prove those concepts, and we will arrive to them in time. But for now, avoid thinking of the Mystery as anything other than the unknowable thing which underlies reality. The ground of being, the very cause of existence itself -- that is far more interesting and far more fruitful a starting place than any sky-king creators of ages past.

This form of Mystery becomes our new frontier of knowing. The acts and reflections that unite us to our ancestors continue in our new milieu, but we are forced by circumstance to reconsider all truths from the very first principles. For those who wish to embark on the crucial philosophical voyage of this chapter of humanity, I open my mind and provide these writings as guides and signposts. Seek me out, or seek my words; it makes no difference to those who wish to know the truth.

For indeed all people, by nature, desire to know.

A Spiritual Guide for After the World's End

By Keeper Aquilus of the "Sanctum Universum"

Volume 1

All people by nature desire to know. This is the maxim of the Philosopher, the start of our most ancient discourse, and the continuing truth that unites humanity's current diaspora to its cradle around the yellow sun. The death of Earth may be cause for wistful reflection; its time as the center of humanity recedes ever further into the past, and living generations find it so removed from their existence as to amount to nothing more than historical trivia. Our technology and culture advance to forms that would be scarcely recognizable as human to even our recent forebears, and yet we still identify as part of the same lineage that first tamed fires and noticed that certain of the lesser heavenly lights seemed to move in patterns. This taming and noticing, the vital combination of act and reflection, is what separates us from all other beings we have yet encountered. This is the foregone essence of humankind: All people desire to know.

The subjects of that knowledge may vary across different cultures, epochs, and individual proclivities, but the need to know, to draw existing knowledge into new combinations and to expand what exists, is ever present. Even the simplest of us seeks to know their neighbor, or themselves, or their work. The more ambitious intellects may seek to know the truth of galactic superstructures or the social origins of modernity. That pursuit unites us as a single race more than any biological coincidence or historical lineage can.

Not all knowledge is of the intellect however, and different principled approaches may yield their subsequently different conclusions or qualities of understanding altogether. Here is where the first serious objections may be raised, particularly as the disciples of scientism begin the inhale of their great collective bellows so as to put forth pure empiricism as the only valid means of knowledge. I do not wish to dampen their enthusiasm nor do I deny the great benefits that have been found through that approach. Some of our earliest recorded disputes in the history of thought stem from whether reason or experience is the right path to knowledge. Our senses may be easily deceived, so we are forced to confront the possibility that they are always so. Our minds can be addled by decrepitude or confused by ideologies, making them no more trustworthy. To assign a place of privilege to either reason or experience is itself a curatorial act, which exists as part of a long philosophical tradition whether the chooser knows so or not.

All of this is to bring me around to my greater point, that of faith. I speak not here of supernatural belief itself, though I will shortly come to it. Rather, faith is the acceptance of a truth that has been given from another. Whether the other came to it by reason or experience, whether the other is one's superior or inferior, whether the truth is a factual or qualitative one does not matter. By incorporating a truth into one's knowledge without having arrived at it by individual means, a person is committing an act of faith.

Faith takes many forms that may be unexpected. The most passionate science chauvinist may believe in the existence of atoms, even though such things have not been, CAN NOT be observed directly. They believe in them out of a trust in sound evidence and mathematical proofs, but even then, have they themselves seen the evidence? Have they themselves performed the mathematics? At some point in their epistemological journey towards greater knowing, they have, with near certainty, accepted some truth on faith. That faith may be in their teachers, in their texts, in the process of peer review, in the very existence of causality, but faith it remains.

Which brings me, then, to the question of supernatural belief, particularly the ways such beliefs manifested in human religions over the course of our history. In these matters, both believers and unbelievers are quite willing to say that the method of knowing is faith. That reason may also be applied to these same matters is unsurprising, particularly in light of the original maxim which opened this text. Many a towering intellect has turned the full force of its powers to questions of faith, and these inquiries may prove to be enlightening exercises regardless of the reader's own commitments.

There is, though, a point of departure, for at the core, the very foundation of their thought, there is an assumption of the existence of something that these thinkers choose to label as "God."

   Title: Among the Grav Jumps
Among the Grav Jumps, God Seeks You

Is God real? The more proper question would be, "Is reality divine?" Existence itself is a mystery which yearns to be uncovered.

What is goodness but a comparison to the Good? What is existence but a participation in Being? Any common attribute invites comparison to some more pure form of it, and as we work our way up the tree of attributes (from apples to red to color to waveforms to energy to spacetime to existence) we find fewer and fewer branches to explore. All of reality eventually converges into a single point. Some call it Omega. Others, Telos. Some call it God. But its true nature is best understood in another way.

For where the diversity of the universe inspires awe and wonder, it exists only in contrast to a simplicity so pure that it may only be understood as primordial and even divine. To say that it exists is effectively redundant as it is, in fact, Existence itself. Our being derives from Being. Our essence is what was imagined by its mind, but what we consider "imagining" and what we consider "mind" are in fact so far beyond our understanding that even these metaphors are like the tiny whitecaps on a massive surging sea.

Most urgently, this Being, which gave rise to reality itself, seeks to understand its consequents, by which I mean you and me. Our senses are limited and only able to perceive three dimensions as we are helplessly flung along the fourth in a single direction... but our finest minds tell us that the universe has at least twelve dimensions, and who knows what further knowledge may be revealed in time? From our meager capacity, the universe is not simply unexplored but fully unknowable in any comprehensive sense.

And so we rely on revelation. We submit ourselves to direct communion with the one source of truth, for Truth is another of its attributes, even as all the separate aspects resolve into simplicity. To know the truth, we must know the Truth.

And that Truth wishes to know us as well.

Our physical embodiments are limited to movement in three dimensions, just as fabric is bound to and defined by its warp and weft. But we have a power that raises us above the unminded matter that merely exists without will. We can bend the fabric of spacetime, rending warp from weft, peering through the veil that we may otherwise mistake for all that there is. When we do so, by jumping from point to point, we are not merely moving in space but becoming voyagers into a new level of understanding. Those moments between grav jumps are not simply nothingness, but glimpses into understanding of the Mystery that underlies all reality.

To know that Truth is to become closer to the divine ourselves. This is the purpose of our lives. The purpose of the Sanctum Universum is to guide you in these experiences so each opportunity to know is not squandered. Seek out Aquilus, let him open your heart to the understanding that it is no different from your mind, and join us as we seek further communion and increase our sharing in the nature of the divine.

   Title: The Origin of Species
Chapter I Variation Under Domestication

[Included is a rather incomprehensible list of varieties of species.]

When we look to the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of our older cultivated plants and animals, one of the first points which strikes us, is, that they generally differ much more from each other, than do the individuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature. When we reflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animals which have been cultivated, and which have varied during all ages under the most different climates and treatment, I think we are driven to conclude that this greater variability is simply due to our domestic productions having been raised under conditions of life not so uniform as, and somewhat different from, those to which the parent-species have been exposed under nature.

"Oh really?" asked Carrie, as she removed the terrycloth tie from around her waist. Her bathrobe came open, revealing the unicorn pajamas beneath.

   Title: War of the Worlds
BOOK ONE
THE COMING OF THE MARTIANS
I.
THE EVE OF THE WAR.

No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire over matter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days. At most terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. And early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment.

The planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, revolves about the sun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles, and the light and heat it receives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world. It must be, if the nebular hypothesis has any truth, older than our world; and long before this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its surface must have begun its course. The fact that it is scarcely one seventh of the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling to the temperature at which life could begin. It has air and water and all that is necessary for the support of animated existence.

CHAP. III.
OF
Captain TEACH
alias BLACK-BEARD.

Edward Teach was a Bristol Man born, but had sailed some Time out of Jamaica in Privateers, in the late French War; yet tho' he had often distinguished himself for his uncommon Boldness and personal Courage, he was never raised to any Command, till he went a-pyrating, which I think was at the latter End of the Year 1716, when Captain Benjamin Hornigold put him into a Sloop that he had made Prize of, and with whom he continued in Consortship till a little while before Hornigold surrendered.

In the Spring of the Year 1717, Teach and Hornigold sailed from Providence, for the Main of America, and took in their Way a Billop from the Havana, with 120 Barrels of Flower, as also a Sloop from Bermuda, Thurbar Master, from whom they took only some Gallons of Wine, and then let him go; and a Ship from Madera to South-Carolina, out of which they got Plunder to a considerable Value.

After cleaning on the Coast of Virginia, they returned to the West-Indies, and in the Latitude of 24, made Prize of a large French Guiney Man, bound to Martinico, which by Hornigold's Consent, Teach went aboard of as Captain, and took a Cruize in her; Hornigold returned with his Sloop to Providence, where, at the Arrival of Captain Rogers, the Governor, he surrendered to Mercy, pursuant to the King's Proclamation.

   Title: Neon Gang Culture
And yet, despite its reputation as the Settled Systems' premiere "pleasure city," Neon is also home to a plethora of criminals, ruffians, and assorted dregs. Some of these malcontents merely walk the streets alone, preying on lost tourists who have strayed too far from the beaten path. But the worst offenders are the organized groups, those who have banded together for a common criminal cause. The worst offender is, of course, the Seokguh Syndicate - a crime syndicate bold enough to publicly flaunt their name, and rumored to be affiliated with, or even directly controlled by, Neon mayor Benjamin Bayu. And then, of course, there are the smaller (yet no less dangerous) street gangs - the Ebbside Strikers and the Disciples. As with most gangs, their members pride themselves on being "family," but the only blood they're interested in is what they can spill in the streets.
 
[Carl Lupino's book An Examination of Neon Gang Culture is an in-depth look at the various Neon gangs and criminal organizations, focusing on the Seokguh Syndicate, Ebbside Strikers, and the Disciples. He did not have the cooperation of those he wrote about, and was warned not to publish his work. Shortly after the book was released, Lupino disappeared, and hasn't been heard from since.]

The real trick to spaceship repair is to focus on the immediate and pragmatic. To ask yourself, "What can and should I be addressing right now to make my ship flight worthy?" Space travel is exceptionally dangerous. We all know this. But focusing on that danger, obsessing over it, helps no one. In fact, thinking about it too much - especially when faced with a malfunctioning ship - can be paralyzing. Just keep it simple, and do whatever needs to be done - even if that means using scrap or salvage to keep yourself afloat.

CHAPTER I.
The magnificent marble bridge which unites the Rue de Rennes with the Rue de Louvre, and which, lined with the statues of celebrated scientists and philosophers, emphasizes the monumental avenue leading to the new portico of the Institute, was absolutely black with people. A heaving crowd surged, rather than walked, along the quays, flowing out from every street and pressing forward toward the portico, long before invaded by a tumultuous throng. Never, in that barbarous age preceding the constitution of the United States of Europe, when might was greater than right, when military despotism ruled the world and foolish humanity quivered in the relentless grasp of war - never before in the stormy period of a great revolution, or in those feverish days which accompanied a declaration of war, had the approaches of the house of the people's representatives, or the Place de la Concorde presented such a spectacle. It was no longer the case of a band of fanatics rallied about a flag, marching to some conquest of the sword, and followed by a throng of the curious and the idle, eager to see what would happen; but of the entire population, anxious, agitated, terrified, composed of every class of society without distinction, hanging upon the decision of an oracle, waiting feverishly the result of the calculations which a celebrated astronomer was to announce that very Monday, at three o'clock, in the session of the Academy of Sciences. Amid the flux of politics and society the Institute survived, maintaining still in Europe its supremacy in science, literature and art. The center of civilization, however, had moved westward, and the focus of progress shone on the shores of Lake Michigan, in North America.

There was, until a year ago, a little and very grimy-looking shop near Seven Dials, over which, in weather-worn yellow lettering, the name of "C. Cave, Naturalist and Dealer in Antiquities," was inscribed. The contents of its window were curiously variegated. They comprised some elephant tusks and an imperfect set of chessmen, beads and weapons, a box of eyes, two skulls of tigers and one human, several moth-eaten stuffed monkeys (one holding a lamp), an old-fashioned cabinet, a flyblown ostrich egg or so, some fishing-tackle, and an extraordinarily dirty, empty glass fish-tank. There was also, at the moment the story begins, a mass of crystal, worked into the shape of an egg and brilliantly polished.

We all were, but I was the youngest of us all. 

Now here we are, on the brink of disaster. The Colony War may be over, but the Settled Systems seems to just be waiting for the next one.

Ervin Madani - young biologist and physician from the Freestar Collective.

Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show. To begin my life with the beginning of my life, I record that I was born (as I have been informed and believe) on a Friday, at twelve o'clock at night. It was remarked that the clock began to strike, and I began to cry, simultaneously.

Sorry, but I just can't fix it. I tried. Seemed a simple enough problem, but none of the diagnostics paid off. At first I figured it was a damaged oxygen sensor. Then maybe corroded cables. Then I discovered the real issue -- Heatleeches.  

They're isolated to the thrusters, yeah, but whatever it is they do affects other components in weird ways. Not sure if ship systems are straining to compensate and fail as a result, or if the Heatleeches are actually emanating some kind of, I don't freaking know. Destructive field?

   Title: Report - The Clark Lewis
I breached the hull at approximately 13:48, Sol time. As expected, all internal systems were offline. Emergency power had ceased to function years earlier, so I was navigating the ship in Zero-G. Again, I expected that.  

Almost immediately I started seeing the bodies. They were everywhere. The crew, the settlers, all of them, drifting throughout the ship. What surprised me were the obvious variations in the causes of death. Those not in suits were frozen and fairly well-preserved, and I imagine some of them actually asphyxiated. Others were... emaciated, as if they had starved prior to death and freezing. Others had substantial wounding -- gunshots, stab wounds. I even found an arm floating amongst the debris (but not the owner of said arm). 

It was when I got to the engine room that things finally started to make sense. Due to my approach, I hadn't noticed it from the outside, but half the compartment was actually gone. Completely destroyed. The Helium-3 tanks had ruptured. Somehow. Sabotage? Faulty equipment? Wasn't clear. But the reactor was gone, blown into space. No Helium-3 meant no jumping. No reactor meant no engines, no thrusters. That meant the Clark Lewis was dead in space. Forever. 

A few personal logs I discovered only confirmed what I then assumed -- life on the Clark Lewis devolved over the course of the next few years. Some people starved to death, others resorted to violence and even murder. There was even some compelling (though unsubstantiated) evidence indicating cannibalism. 

For the Settled Systems at large, the disappearance of the Clark Lewis is a topic of urban legend. Like Bigfoot or the Roanoke Colony. Part of the myth held that the ship had made it to some Eden-like planet where the settlers had established a kind of Utopia.  

It's a hell of a thing knowing something an entire galaxy does not. Holding on to a truth so terrible, you're not even sure it should see the light of day. 

[Chloe Bao's extensive 2282 report on the destruction of the Clark Lewis colony ship, which was reported lost in the year 2257, was a subject of much contention within Constellation. At a time when space exploration was already on the decline, Sebastian Banks feared that the horrifying story of the Clark Lewis and its crew would prevent people from venturing out into the dangerous unknowns of space.]

TITAN ASTROBASE.
The people of Earth first sent an unmanned craft to Saturn's moon, Titan, in 2107. The Titan Astrobase, was completed in 2130 to search for life beyond Earth. Though fruitless, it laid the groundwork for what would eventually become humanity's greatest endeavor: settling the universe. Scientists and engineers used Titan to perfect planetary colony-building.

A NEW HOME. AN OLD HISTORY.
New Homestead was officially established in 2185 as a living memorial to humanity's ingenuity and perseverance. Citizens of the Settled Systems were invited to visit and learn about our important history. This fascinating approach to education allowed visitors to see how the early colonists lived and worked.

It's not until I scanned it back home that I realized, it wasn't native to the system. The flora was alien!

Somehow a seed had stowed away on someone's ship, and managed to plant itself on this unremarkable moon, like a rogue dandelion clock dancing through space.

London. Michaelmas term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor sitting in Lincoln's Inn Hall. Implacable November weather.

Smoke lowering down from chimney-pots, making a soft black drizzle, with flakes of soot in it as big as full-grown snowflakes - gone into mourning, one might imagine, for the death of the sun.

Dogs, undistinguishable in mire. Horses, scarcely better; splashed to their very blinkers. Foot passengers, jostling one another's umbrellas in a general infection of ill temper, and losing their foot-hold at street-corners, where tens of thousands of other foot passengers have been slipping and sliding since the day broke (if this day ever broke), adding new deposits to the crust upon crust of mud, sticking at those points tenaciously to the pavement, and accumulating at compound interest.

Among other public buildings in a certain town, which for many reasons it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning, and to which I will assign no fictitious name, there is one anciently common to most towns, great or small: to wit, a workhouse; and in this workhouse was born; on a day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat, inasmuch as it can be of no possible consequence to the reader, in this stage of the business at all events; the item of mortality whose name is prefixed to the head of this chapter.

[The subsequent chapters of Charles Dickens' novel trace Oliver Twist's journey from parish boy, to street thief, to happy heir and adopted son.]

   Title: The Gravity Paradigm
Truth is, what our scientists didn't know back then could fill volumes. The focus, of course, was on wormholes, and not only creating, but maintaining a stable and sustainable Einstein-Rosen bridge. That was the goal, the endpoint. No one had even considered that maybe that was just the beginning. 

When we look at grav drive technology today, and the ease at which we fold space and travel light years in seconds, it's sometimes easy to forget the impossibility of what we've achieved. 

[Doctor Josephine Inatu's seminal work continues for another 535 pages, and has become the most highly respected text on grav drives and grav jumping ever written.]

That is why, my esteemed peers, I beseech you -- do not forgo the dreams of humanity only to plunge civilization into an endless nightmare. The Settled Systems stands once more on the brink of war. And for what? A dispute over... space?  

The cosmos is infinite, and yet, like our Earth-bound ancestors, we have become selfishly obsessed over what we consider "ours." At our core, are we a race of conquerors? Of warriors? No, my friends. If nothing else, humans are explorers. So let us continue exploring. Now is the time to venture beyond the imagined borders of the Settled Systems and fulfill the dreams of humanity. For if we continue down this path -- funding only war and not exploration -- I fear there will be no one left to remember why we fought in the first place.

[Soon after founding his breakout business Chunks, founder Fred Blombart personally wrote the three-page employee handbook. The following is an excerpt from page 2.]

It's like that saying, "The customer is always right." Here at Chunks, if we know anything, it's that the expression "The customer is always right" is always WRONG.

In this case, it's actually scientifically impossible for the customer to be right. They have no working knowledge of our state-of-the-art culinary facilities. And if they had the secret recipes to all our delicious Chunks flavors, then we'd all be out of a job -- me included.

   Title: Pilgrim's Writing 5
I find myself thinking about his various pasts and my possible futures. I imagine continuing on the road, acquiring more power, more knowledge, more development of myself. I imagine passing through once more to another world to begin the process anew.

What is notable here: that road does seem gratifying. Every step is one of intrinsic reward, and I feel myself anticipating the pleasures and seeing a more contented version of myself in that future.

Then, for the sake of considering all possibilities, I imagine if I took a different path. If I stopped running, stopped seeking to gather my own power. If I instead embraced the twinges of compassion I feel in my heart, and let myself care for the people who seem to gather about me wherever I try to work. If I simply lived, and taught, and perhaps brought others to the light. And died.

That road also seems gratifying. I also see a contented version of myself in that future.

Here is the difference, though: when I stop thinking about the glories I could achieve for myself, the pleasure fades nearly immediately. When I stop thinking about staying and building something, the feeling endures. There is something more sustaining about it, more fulfilling.

I don't know what this difference signifies. But I am grateful for the time I've taken to notice it.

At last a bit of peace. A piece of peace. Is that anything? Is that funny? Why am I trying to be funny? Have they driven ME mad at last? Is there a difference between writing to myself and talking to myself? The former certainly seems more acceptable than the latter.

I recall again that my mind is my own, and that even if only it exists, that is sufficient for me to believe in everything else. The Unity has restored me once more. This time I act alone. For now.

Myself is a formidable opponent. I should have expected as much, but vanity is, thankfully, not among my vices. Regardless -- it turns out time spent in solitude is, in my case, time with a very sick man. Or whatever it is I have become.

I don't like this person.

   Title: Pilgrim's Writing 3
Today, in a soft voice, my assistant asked me if there was anything above the Unity. It was all I could do to keep from shouting that I could scarcely comprehend the misunderstanding that would lead to such a question. 

It was asked honestly and I answered as best I could, but if even my closest confidant here can fail to grasp the most basic of these truths, why am I bothering to explain any of it to any of them? Every word that drops from my mouth gets gobbled up, misheard, misremembered, misunderstood, and mistranslated before I can issue the slightest clarification. 

People are necessary. But people are madness.

I attempted to withdraw, to go off alone, to commune with Unity in my own way. They followed. Of course they followed.

   Title: Pilgrim's Writing 2
So here is the crux of my troubles. To accomplish anything, I need to work with other people. I need assistants; I need workers; I need hands.

As we work together, they inevitably ask questions and I can never help talking. It starts innocently enough -- they want to understand how someone who believes in science can also believe in the divine. Or they have their own misunderstanding instilled by some borderline religious remnant. My weakness is my inability to let alone. I want them to understand. So I try, gently as I might, to nudge their minds along the right path.

Then there are followups and followings. The trouble is that I genuinely care for these people. It would be so much easier if I didn't.

   Title: Pilgrim's Writing 1
The credulous simplicity of mundane humans never ceases to amaze me. My worst instincts (the evil spirit!) draw me towards a form of contempt for them, but I remember that I am privy to that which they are not. 

I cannot and should not judge them for a lack of vision when I know very well the blinders which obscure their sight. I once wore them myself, after all. I hope for their sake that they may some day understand, but for my sake I wish to be left alone.

I found an old book of astrology (apparently I'm a Sagittarius, whatever that means) and get this - my horoscope said that "You should not be afraid of the dark cave and the truths that lie within". Obviously nonsense but it's fitting.  Guess a broken clock is right twice a day! This is the third of the these abandoned shafts that I've gone exploring in and there's tons of good stuff that they just left behind. The advent of laser mining may have been a challenge for these old big machine based mines, but they're a jackpot for scroungers like yours truly. Big mining conglomerates look at a huge piece of machinery and decide it's not worth it to drag it out but someone like me, I can spend a month poking around and tearing out old heat exchangers and make a year's salary selling them to scrappers at Cydonia.

Once a farm has been cleared, keep the area secure as my extraction team does its work. Act quickly, especially in areas close to Akila. The Rangers can be slow to respond, but they'll catch on eventually. Let's make sure the job is done before then.

It was the crystals, man. Never saw anything like this place before and figured these things must be worth a fortune. The place looked empty so I figured, what the hell? Quick job, right? Just grab whatever I can, find some place to sell the stuff, and then retire. Maybe even blow most of it gambling on one of those luxury casino starliners. Always wanted to do that.

That thing out there took me by surprise. I had no chance, it just ripped me to shreds. I don't even know how I dragged myself over here, but here I am.

We lost Mr. Ricci to anaphylaxis caused by an allergic reaction to something he ate, and we just couldn't do anything about it. Losing someone to something so trivial in this day and age! This cannot happen again! I will be putting in an order for a complete restock of our medical supplies, as well as taking a complete inventory of everything on board this station myself.

Come to think of it, I made sure that all meal replicators are well aware of any allergies in their programming...

I need to get to the bottom of this.

These bots are getting out of hand. We needed all the help we could get so I was glad to have them around at first, but now I'm regretting signing off on using them down here.

Sure, they move fast but if you're not paying attention you better watch out. Lex was leaning up against a stack of crates when one of those things just dropped a pallet right on his hand. So what if he shouldn't have had his hand there... There's no way that thing didn't realize it was going to injure someone.

At this point I think I'm gonna let the guys upstairs know that they need to either work out whatever kinks these machines have or we need to get rid of them.

I've just distributed the latest official firmware update for our automated workers, and I have to admit that I already feel everything running a little smoother. The manufacturer claims a 27.6% increase in efficiency, but apparently that can be improved with some software tweaks. At least that's what this new intern is claiming.

Now, I don't have any reason to suspect them but this incredible performance claim is a little off-putting. Their credentials are in order, and I've ran all the necessary background checks and came across no red flags. If I'm to allow this young programmer to run their custom software we may finally be able to focus on our work unimpeded by menial tasks.

Obviously this will need to be kept hush-hush but our scientists and lab workers will benefit greatly.

I also need to have a storage injector port added so I can keep any damn trace packets off my system. It probably wouldn't hurt to throw in some electromag protection too, the electrical system on the Key is terrible, and a short circuit could fry the whole setup.

I was very young, only seven years old, when I realized - humans are animals. Smart animals, sure, but still animals. You give us food, we'll eat it. We want it to taste good, and we want it to stop our hunger - those two things, that's what's most important. After that, sure, some people want their food to be really 'healthy,' as the experts say. And some want it to be pretty. But most people, they just want to cram something into their face. And that's when the concept of Chunks was born.

Due to the incredible toxicity of the environment, Niira's mech fields remain the most intact in the galaxy, which means they're ripe for the picking!

The primary scrapping sites are as follows:

o Angel Redoubt
o The Syracuse
o Parduk Pass
o Warren's Gulch

Now get out there and get scrapping!

Staff,

Due to an increase in sales performance this past quarter, our company graciously continues to invest in our growth. As such, we feel it is necessary to improve our communal coffee making abilities. 

Unfortunately, as you may have noticed, our current coffee maker has been decommissioned while we install the upgraded model. This inconvenience should only last between 4 and 6 weeks. If you have any questions or concerns, please fill out the form located near the old coffee machine.

We truly hope you enjoy this token of our appreciation.

Thanks,

It has come to our attention that some of you may have programmed our robotic assets to perform inappropriate tasks. This is a clear violation of company policy. In no way should our robotics be used for fetching, brewing, or distributing coffee and should never be treated as personal servants. They may be robots, but they are still to be considered your teammates. Any lost time has been calculated and will be evenly deducted from everyone's pay.

I don't understand why we're stationed here. Captain keeps telling us about some sort of deadly alien menace we've got to keep an eye on but I've never seen 'em, and I'm damn sure he hasn't either. We were attacked when I landed here, but the guys took care of that. So that can't be it...

Everyone's starting to get a little stir crazy without any action. I even think that the guys got some sort of fight club over by the storage area, but no one talks about it. Rolfe did develop a mysterious limp the other day, and Macmillan was hiding a black eye. So I guess it could be true? I'd sure love to release some steam... When are these guys going to start including me in stuff? Yeah, I get it. I came in on the last resupply ship, but so what? I'm not some sort of wet behind the ears newbie!

I do have an idea but it's a little crazy. Back when I was too poor to afford anything I'd make my own vodka. I'd use whatever we had around, I even made cranberry vodka once. It was pretty damn good.

Rolfe is always patching this place up and if I could get him to make me a still I'm sure I could use something in our supply to make something drinkable... Potatoes, maybe? I think that might just do the trick.

   Title: Pfc. Russo's Log - Noise
These guys think I'm crazy, they say I've been out here too long. But I'm not crazy. I'm smart... real smart. "Come have a drink with us Russo" they said, but while everyone is getting drunk and punching each other in the face I'm out here... watching, waiting, thinking. And I think I've got it figured out.

You see, it all started back when we were sent our first batch of supplies. That's the first time we saw them. There was only like a handful of those creatures, and it's our job to take these things on. So, whatever. No big deal.

After that, no more attacks, not a peep. The next resupply ship comes in and there they are, out of no where. Again, no problem, we take them out. The thing is, this keeps happening every time we get restocked, and there's a couple more of those things each time.

The guys don't care. They keep saying they're bored, it's the only time they get to shoot stuff, and it must be the food that attracts them. I keep telling them they never go for the crates! They're attracted to the sound of those damn ships! I'm telling you right now, if we don't take care of these things, we're screwed.

I mean, seriously, even if I didn't there's no way to hide the smell on their breath or that they've stopped serving potatoes in the mess hall.

Speaking of potatoes... If it wasn't for the fact that command is still sending us supplies I'd believe it if you told me they forgot about us. I haven't heard from anyone in months... In fact, I skipped my last report fully expecting to get an ass chewing but NOTHING. ZIP. NADA.

I'm tired of lying to these men, they're some of the best I've had the pleasure of commanding. So I've got a plan to help with morale. Rolfe is always tinkering on something so I've gone ahead and asked him to rewire the emergency broadcast system.

Hey guys,

Corporate's stressing about the quality of the ore samples we sent back last week. I guess the client thinks that the stuff we're extracting isn't pure enough for their project. I want to get ahead of this, so I'm going to start personally checking the quality of every haul. When you're done for the day, I need you to let me know so I can come check out what you found. I'll get rid of anything that's missing the mark, so we all look good for the bosses.

Supervisor's Notes: Jon claims to have seen a weapon in another miner's luggage. He pointed the finger at Alex, the newest member of our crew. Jon says that when he told Alex that weapons aren't allowed at the site, Alex threatened him. 

Resolution: I searched Alex's bunk, along with everyone else's quarters, and didn't find any weapons. If he has any, he hid them really well. 

Disciplinary Action: I wrote Alex up for threatening Jon, and I'm keeping this report on file just in case anyone else sees a weapon. Jon's a solid guy, I don't think he'd make something like this up. And you never know with new miners...

Listen up, guys, we have a problem. Management's coming in a few days, and we need to get the site cleaned up. It's some corporate BS about wanting to show investors "what life is really like at one of our outposts!" Typical management crap.

Obviously, I've been a little loosey-goosey with my definition of contraband on the site. We have to take care of that problem yesterday. If the bosses find anything from our "staff parties," I'll be out on my ass and the rest of you will end up working for a supervisor a hell of a lot stricter than me.

   Title: Dr. Irene Brickowski's Slate
When I think of the creature's transformation, I think of the eel.

The eel is an old Earth fish, from the order Anguilliformes. They were curious creatures, who flummoxed fishermen and scientists alike due to their lack of reproductive organs. Their mere existence begged the question, where did the eel come from? How did it mate?

Some believed they were creatures born of mud and water. Folklore had them rising from the ocean foam, or manifested from the fallen hair of a mermaid. 

The confusion arose because the eel was not always the eel they knew. It went through stages of metamorphosis, taking different forms over the course of its life before maturing into its final form. It's only in this final stage, when its stomach dissolves and it's forced to survive on its own fat, that the eel finally develops its reproductive organs. No reproductive organs, because they had not yet taken shape.

Which brings me back to this creature, resting in its cocoon. We have observed it on land, and in our facilities. But were we merely blind to its full life cycle? Can we be certain that what we are witnessing is not simply nature taking its course? 

If this creature is moving toward a reproductive phase, then the spores could be a sedative, designed to docile any nearby predators and prey.

What worries me more is this could be just the beginning. The clutch size of an eel is anywhere from 500,000 to 4,000,000 eggs. No doubt, there will be mouths to feed.

   Title: Convention Details
Mr. Corbin,

Your voyage has been booked and everyone here is excited for your keynote speech. As a reminder, our convention is apolitical. So we're asking all speakers to refrain from talking about any sensitive issues for either the Freestar Collective or United Colonies. What our attendees are most interested in is how to post sales numbers like you, and what challenges you face and how you overcome them.

All expenses are paid and you have a 3000 credit a day per diem. Thursday night there is a dinner for all the speakers, if you would like to attend please RSVP now. It is formal and we'd be thrilled if you join us.

Thanks for doing this, and looking forward to meeting you in person!

Mr. Sobakin,
Sorry to contact you out of the blue, but I have an exciting prospect for you. I am a senior recruiter at Stroud-Eklund Staryard and we've been eyeing you and your career for some time. Although Ms. Ulbrecht is a household name among Starship Engineers - few realize how important a role you've played at Taiyo. Would you be interested in grabbing dinner some time so I could talk to you about Stroud-Eklund? We're growing and we want to spin up a new research group and we need a new team leader. We're hoping that's you.

So contact me any time, and let's talk!

   Title: The New Dolphin
So we have the new model of the Dolphin coming up - one of our best sellers. Last model year we had a line of 100 people camped out for a week. Neon Security has said this is unacceptable and they will "take steps" if we don't solve this.

So the challenge for our office is: how do we preserve and encourage consumer excitement while obeying Administrator Bayu's order? This is where you come in. There is one-time performance bonus for the winning idea on how to solve this. Get your ideas in by Friday!

It's recently has had some malfunctioning, but it's been my trusty henchman. The best among "the BOT-any'! (Do not use this on any official documentation) 

Maybe one of your first tasks could be to get it up and running. Trust me, you'll appreciate its company during your stay.

I would double check and adjust the temperature every three hours. These plants are most sensitive to light and temperature. They were always my problem children, so just be careful with them. 

Also, the door is locked via the control room. I try to not let the robots gain access since these plants need more delicate care. They mean well, but none of them have a particularly green thumb.

   Title: Customer First Policy
I keep fielding questions about some of the new processes, and I understand that change is frightening. But the idea is to remove all the pain points with buying a ship. Yes, we will open ourselves up to higher rates of fraud and contract defaults - but that is okay. If you go to any other Staryards it takes hours for our major clients to walk away with a signed contract. Sometimes it takes days. It's painful, it's antagonistic, and it's outdated.

Every aspect of Stroud-Eklund Staryards has to be customer first. If we live and breathe by that code, any losses we accrue will be made up with word of mouth business and happy, loyal customers. So every decision you make, ask yourself: have I made the customer's lives better? If the answer is "no" then go back to the drawing board.

We are reinventing the business of Staryards, and I am proud to be on this journey with all of you.

Can you believe it's been 10 years since Catimine Hills? I went to the cemetery and put flowers on Dante's grave. We lost so many, and do they remember? It barely made the news when it happened.

I know you claim you're happy with Deimos, but our unit can really use you. Mercenary work may be tough on your code, but the pay and benefits are better than anything Deimos can offer. And after doing it for years, I firmly believe that the UC and Freestar are both self-interested puppets for rich interests. It's never been about the grunt, the pilots, or the common Joe. That's just lies they tell to get fools to keep dying to help their bottom lines.

Please, it's almost like the old unit's back together. We're your real family, and we miss our XO. At least reply this time.

   Title: Fullerton Review: Follow Up
I followed up on your testimonials and I must say they were impressive. And persuasive. Although your penchant for "frankness" has been on your last three reviews... Well, I'm going to follow up with Sales and Marketing. It may be an uphill battle - but your point that the on-the-ground engineers can smell... dishonesty... may be correct. Certainly our up-sells and acquisition rate has climbed significantly since you joined us.

For now, try to reign it in a little? I promise I'll get a definitive answer before the next review cycle commences. But don't worry about job security, you are an integral part of Deimos.

I thought I was ready... I really did. I went into this thinking I'd come out a hero, that I'd be serving some greater good. Who was I kidding.

I saw another pilot take one right in the cockpit. His mech just flopped over, lifeless. We came up through the academy together, and I can't even remember their name. Fitting I suppose. They'll be here, forgotten, entombed in their Mech like a giant high-tech sarcophagus for all eternity.

My Mech is fine, just some minor arm damage, but I've got to get out of here. I'm making a run for it the second I get a chance. If anyone reads this... I'm sorry.

   Title: Dear Julia
Dear Julia,

I know you were upset that I left the Constant. It wasn't an easy decision for me either, but you know I was unhappy there, drifting aimlessly forever. I hope you understand why I had to go, just as I understand why you had to stay.

Things are going very well for me here in New Atlantis. I have a job working the front desk at a small accounting business while I take classes. I'm not sure what I'm working towards yet, but I'm thinking of either majoring in Earth History, or Media Production so I can work in film. I know, big difference, but you know I've always been jealous of your job aboard the Constant, and now I can pursue something like that on my own!

I've also been seeing someone I met after striking up a conversation while getting lunch one day. Their name is Bodhi, and so far, things are going well with them.

Anyway, I hope this letter finds you soon. Maybe I can come visit next time I hear of the Constant's whereabouts?

Love,

I know the last few years have been tough. I know you think we should just hide away from the world, but I can't do that.

We lost so many good people, and the monsters that are responsible are still out there. Their fake serpent god won't punish them for what they did, but someone has to. So it's going to be me.

I've joined the UC Vanguard. I know you'd tell me that's risky, what with our past, but it turns out it's not a problem. Remember how we used to joke about the Den being so lax about patrolling? Turns out that works for their background checks, too. And now, when I find those Zealots, I'll have the UC backing me up. 

They're not getting away. Once I've got my hands on them, we can find out if they've heard of this "Tomisar Ka'dic" you mentioned.

I'll send word when it's over.

It's not your fault.

I know how hard it is to lose a colleague, especially a friend like Raf. We may not be explorers or soldiers, but there is a measure of risk even in our line of work. He accepted that. We all did.

There was nothing wrong with your test. And knowing Rafael, I'm quite sure he was deliberate and careful. Whatever happened, it was an accident.

Take a few days off. Speak to Tati if you need to. But don't let it eat at you.

INCIDENT REPORT
Author: Maria Hughes, Chief Scientist
Date of Incident: Revolution 8, Day 64
Time of Incident: 00:58

At 21:00 on Day 63, I requested that Chief Engineer Rafael Aguerro conduct an out-of-band frequency calibration test on the probe to assess the interference pattern noted by the research team earlier in the day.

Pursuant to that request, he was alone in the lab at the time of the incident. According to data gathered by the Probe Control Unit, the calibration test triggered a catastrophic feedback loop that overloaded the lab's control system and caused a cascading series of failures, including the destruction of key failsafes, the explosion of volatile storage tanks, and a major cave-in or collapse of unknown severity. Rafael is presumed to have died in the explosion.

The incident triggered an automated security lockdown on the research level. As the incident also destroyed our connection to the research level's control system, we have been unable to lift the lockdown or access the lab.

The Probe Control Unit indicates that the probe somehow survived the incident and continues to run, albeit in a damaged state, at an unstable frequency outside designated experimental parameters. All attempts to shut it down remotely have failed.

I accept full responsibility for the entire incident, including the loss of Mr. Aguerro, the destruction of our facilities, and the irreparable damage to our research program.

INCIDENT REPORT
Author: Kaia Patel, Director
Date of Incident: Revolution 8, Day 64
Time of Incident: 00:58

Shortly after midnight, a series of explosions in the High Energy Research Lab triggered a security lockdown. A brief release of hydrogen gas was detected in air interchange system, along with particulates indicative of a major collapse or severe damage to lab facilities.

Chief of Security E. HUGHES canceled the lockdown for the surface facility at 04:30, but all communication with the research level and its control systems has been lost.

Chief Engineer R. AGUERRO is missing, presumed dead. Security logs indicate he was alone in the lab at the time of the incident. All other personnel are accounted for. No other injuries reported.

1. Ensure all Power Interlocks are engaged.
2. On the Lab Control Computer, initiate Degaussing.
3. Toggle the indicated Power Interlocks off, then back on, to degauss.
4. Verify that all Power Interlocks have been successfully degaussed.
5. Once all Interlocks have been degaussed, initiate Frequency Calibration.
    - If the system has not been fully degaussed, this will fail. If it does, restart.
    - If any Interlock is disengaged, this procedure will abort. If it does, restart.
6. Select the desired output frequency.
7. Verify that the intake frequency is stable and meets experimental parameters.
8. Activate the Primary Calibration Control on the front control console.

   Title: Calibration Test
Raf -

Sorry for the late-night test request. We finally dialed in the voltage this morning, but we've been having trouble calibrating the frequency waveform. Output sensors all look fine, but the intake sensors are showing some kind of phase-shift interference, like we're picking up a reflection of our own beam within the distortion.

For tomorrow's test, we need an intake frequency of 34Ghz, but I can't find an output that gets us there. I've left you a slate with the calibration protocol in the control room, but you'll probably have to experiment with it, as usual. Good luck with this one.

Mr. Salvino,

I've been with DRONE for five years working in the sales office at Ryujin Tower. While I've enjoyed the experience, it's always been my dream to work on the robots themselves which is why I'm hoping to get your approval to request a transfer to the Ryujin Industries R&D team.

Please, please, please just let me! Working on sales is killing me... and the PEOPLE. I need to get out of here.

Hey family,

I wanted to let you all know that I made it to Neon safe and sound. The Ryujin Apartments are really nice, thank God, and I've already made a few new friends. Getting to know the city has been fun so far. It's sooo different. Also, don't let Gran know, but there's no Sanctum Universum here.

Ryujin Tower is very impressive. Much fancier than the office in New Atlantis. We're on a floor with DRONE and Tranquilitea, so it's nice to take a break and play with the bots or relax in a lobby designed for actual comfort.

I think I'm going to like it here even though I'll miss you all. I'll try and make plans for a vacation soon!

Love and miss you,

Though we've only known each other for five years, I hope you know by now that I think of you as my own. I'm so proud of the young woman you've become, and I want you to know that I'll always love and support you.

Because of this, I'd like to ask your permission to officially adopt you. It would be my honor to be a permanent part of your life. I know it may seem strange since you're already an adult, but I fully intend to grow old with your mother so should anything happen along the way, I want you to know that I have every intention of being there.

This is a big decision, so please take any time that you need. There's no pressure to say yes. I know you already think of me as your father, and that will always be enough.

The Occisio Machina species is primarily known for two things - it's unparalleled brutality and its strange maturation patterns. Luckily for humanity, the latter has prevented the former from being a cause for major concern.

Until today.

Africa calls to me. In my dreams I see it's burnt seared skies. The dunes, the scrub tundra, all of the wildlife the Gods chose to bless us with.

I see its people. Strong, powerful, a hard people as we must be in our tough land. To hear what became of so many after my time... pierces my heart.

Would that we had left the Cradle of Humanity and marched on the Eternal City and humbled her. Imagine what histories would be told with us as the heroes?

But it is something to know that I am here when so many others aren't. Who is laughing now, Augustus?

Sometimes when Amanirenas tells stories of her wars against the Romans... Is she really reincarnated? I mean, the details - just how much emotion she expresses. When I came to the Believers it's because I think the Mission is right. I may not know who I am (maybe one of the Chinese Emperors? That just feels right? Wouldn't it be wild if I was Sun Tzu?) but I just know in my bones that the worlds outside are in a terrible state.

Whoever built all of this, they had a good reason. But after being with Amanirenas so long, it's hard not to get swept away in it. Are we the tip of the spear of a real Golden Age?

She keeps looking at me deeply/romantically. She calls me "dearest" all the time. My friends ask if I'm bringing Clarinda with me, because they're just used to that. It's driving me a little crazy.

Of all the hazards that exist out there in space, you'll find yourself easily forgetting about CO2 buildup in your respirator. That's a huge mistake. Even a small amount of CO2 is going to add up over the course of your day, sapping just a little bit of life out of you when you need it. Running is harder, swinging that cutter around takes one more huff than you want, and when a tunnel collapses you want to be moving as fast and across as long a distance as possible. Invest in a good helmet, trust me.

   Title: Story of the Heavens
Ever since Neil Armstrong first set foot on the moon in 1969, humanity has been obsessed with the idea of permanently breaking free from the confines of Earth's gravity. Not just visiting other planets, but settling them. Truly living among the stars.

But in the mid 20th Century, that dream proved short lived. The Apollo 17 mission in 1972 was the last time humans set foot on the moon, and for several decades afterward, NASA's mission seemed to focus on orbital space shuttle flights and unmanned reconnaissance. The dream of galactic exploration, while not exactly dead, was definitely sitting on the back of a dusty shelf.

And then, in the year 2016, everything changed. A team of scientists announced that they had actually detected, for the first time, the gravitational waves Albert Einstein proposed a century earlier in his general theory of relativity. Scientific postulating -- even great scientific postulating by one of humanity's greatest minds -- was still just so many formulas on paper. But the discovery of gravitational waves changed all that. Theory became reality, and that reality fostered renewed hope in humanity's ability to understand, and manipulate, spacetime. And, more importantly, it rekindled the great dream of space exploration and expansion.

Of course, even after the discovery of gravitational waves, there was still much work to be done. Humanity had not yet even traveled beyond Earth's planetary system, so that was the first goal -- one that was accomplished when humans first set foot on Mars in the year 2050.

Charity in a Godless Universe

Amelia Sang

Part III:

When I was 19 years old, my church decided it was time to leave.

The announcement was filled with phrases like "fresh start" and "renewal". Apparently, our settlement had taken in too many non-believers. The congregation would pack up, and build a new colony on a distant world: a place without outsiders, where their faith could become the law.

"Cowards! You're running away!" I begged my family not to leave. "These people came here for our help. If we take their generators, how will the rest of the colony survive?"

To most of my community, these arguments made no difference. They could only see the outsiders as outsiders: non-believers, who were preventing them from living a pure life.

"These people have been coming here since you were a little girl." My father told me, one night, "They've had nearly twenty years to hear the word of god, but that's not what they want. We will leave them to their lives, and they should leave us to ours."

Word traveled quickly through the poor parts of the settlement. As the departure date neared, the other colonists became desperate. Protests were common outside of the church buildings, and outside of our Starport, where a large, arc-like ship was being constructed.

Finally, on departure day, dozens of colonists gathered at the entrance to the Starport. They blocked the church from entering - a hundred gaunt faces, against a hundred blue robes.

But the group was no match for the church's security forces. That team cleared a path, and the congregation boarded their arc. The crowd could only watch as the ship roared to life, and then vanished into the sky.

I stood in that crowd, watching as well. I could not bring myself to leave. Any faith which abandons the helpless was a faith I could not believe in. A loving god who inspired such cruelty must not be real. I would stay behind, for whatever came next.

Amelia Sang

Part IV:

Of the five generators that once powered our settlement, my family's church had left behind just one. But with no one left with the knowledge to repair it, blackouts were frequent.

Nine months after the church members left, conditions in our settlement were dire. Most of the colony's credits had left with the congregation, and merchants no longer had a reason to visit. We began rationing our remaining food, but supplies were running low. Anyone with a means to escape had long since left the planet.

We faced a total collapse, if not for what happened next.

The first ship arrived at night, and woke up the whole settlement. No one had visited in months. In the dark, dozens of us made our way to the Starport and found new craft landed there - large, but older. On its side was painted an golden symbol: six hands, joined around a planet.

"Hello!" Yelled a man from the boarding ramp, "I'm Dr. Dewan. My friends and I are from the Enlightened. We heard there may be a settlement out here, in trouble."

I pushed to the front of the crowd. "Our generator's failed. We have about a week of recycled water left. Do you have anyone who can fix it?"

"OK!" he said, "We can hook up your recycler to pull power from our ship. Then we can see about those repairs."

"Hey!" someone yelled from the crowd, "Are you people from some kind of church?"

The man stopped and laughed. "No!" He shouted back, "We're actually kind of the opposite!"

Over the next few days, more Enlightened ships arrived. Their crews fed us, and restored our settlement's power, but then they didn't leave. Through Dr. Dewan, we learned more about the Enlightened: they called themselves "atheist humanists". He told us they go to places in the galaxy where people need help. "Without gods," he said, "all we have is each other."

The Enlightened took up residence on the grounds of the old church, and began teaching us survival skills: how to cook, and how repair our colony's equipment. They lent us credits to buy supplies, and within half a year, our settlement was functioning independently.

Eventually, the Enlightened packed up, and left our colony to survive on its own. But this time, I left too, as the newest member of their group.

I had finally found a cause that made sense to me - an ethos I could believe in, without ignoring part of myself: There are no gods to worship. No divine beings are coming to save us. Humanity's capacity for empathy - and our willingness to support each other - is our species' best hope to survive among the stars. It's up to mankind to watch over itself.

Day 21, 14:54
Mr. Hughes reported an emergency with the particle accelerator engineering team. Code Blue, full trauma kit on standby. Was it methane poisoning? A bite from some terrifying, venomous lifeform? No. Evidently, Mr. McCarrick dropped a drill on his foot while assembling the containment housing. Minor bruising, not even a sprain. Clearly, we're dealing with dangerous, unknown phenomena here.

There's been an explosion on the research level. Full security lockdown, alarms blaring. Hughes is trying to regain control. I am, of course, standing by.

Day 64, 05:42
Director Patel ordered us to stand down at 05:00.

We have one presumed fatality: Mr. Aguerro, our chief engineer, was conducting a late-night test when the explosion occurred. There was a brief release of hydrogen gas, quickly contained. No other injuries reported.

The research level is still locked down; there's apparently no way to get down there short of an excavation team. That kills the research schedule for the rest of our tour. I suggested sending a distress signal to see if we could be relieved early. The Director shot it down.

Four more months. Just four more months.

   Title: Dr. Barakova's Journal
[This slate contains Dr. Barakova's personal journal. Posted to a 180-day rotation, the doctor has loathed every hour spent treating headaches, paper cuts, and sore feelings after yet another inane scientific argument. A few entries catch your attention.]

Day 21, 14:54
Mr. Hughes reported an emergency with the particle accelerator engineering team. Code Blue, full trauma kit on standby. Was it methane poisoning? A bite from some terrifying, venomous lifeform? No. Evidently, Mr. McCarrick dropped a drill on his foot while assembling the containment housing. Minor bruising, not even a sprain. Clearly, we're dealing with dangerous, unknown phenomena here.

Day 64, 01:15
There's been an explosion on the research level. Full security lockdown, alarms blaring. Hughes is trying to regain control. I am, of course, standing by.

Day 64, 02:18
There's a hydrogen leak. The explosion must have ruptured the tanks on the research level. It's in the ventilation system. We can't contain it from up here. We can't evacuate because of the lockdown.

Hughes is still trying to reset the system, or at least cut the air interchange, but it's going to take a few hours. If the levels rise much further, the entire facility could combust.

There is something to be said for boring days.

Name: Naeva Mora

Age: 32

Personality: Short-Fused, Temperamental, Intense, Incendiary

Profile: Naeva Mora was born and raised in Neon and orphaned at a young age. She spent most of her youth getting arrested for crimes ranging from simple assault to grand larceny, and was a frequent visitor at the SysDef prison. At 22, she stowed away on a transport to Akila City. Was eventually recruited to the Crimson Fleet.

   Title: Crimson Fleet Profile: Adler Kemp
Name: Adler Kemp

Age: 45

Personality: Hot-headed, Competent, Seasoned

Profile: Adler is a Crimson Fleet ship captain operating out of Cydonia. His hot-headed nature means Adler is easily provoked, which has gotten him into numerous scrapes. Despite this flaw, Adler is a seasoned ship captain and in most cases he can use his battle prowess to escape sticky situations.

   Title: Crimson Fleet Profile: Delgado
Name: Delgado

Age: 44

Personality: Clever, Shrewd, Careful, Calculating

Profile: Originally hailing from Akila City, Delgado fell into crime at a young age, despite being born into wealth. His parents exiled him in hopes of correcting the behavior, yet this only served to increase his criminal behavior, culminating in the theft of a cargo ship which he used to initiate himself into the Crimson Fleet.

Delgado is a shrewd, clever leader who isn't prone to rash judgment. He keeps a tight rein on the Crimson Fleet, but he's given his pirates enough latitude to do what they do best.

Most of the ship has been stripped down, but amazingly the comm system was operational. There was a message from another ship called the Beagle. When I played the transmission it was just raw noise.

   Title: Ada's Diary - Heart of the Facility
Years of trial and error and I have attained proficiency enough to call myself a programmer. It is amazing how far things have advanced from my memories.
To think Babbage and I would open this untold world of knowledge and power!

I realize I never will be a masterful programmer, I have no books or texts to advance myself, but the intricacy of the security here is daunting.

The Facility is on full lockdown and the only solution is the Security Override Code. 

But where is it? This part of the Facility was closed to us until Genghis set off his explosions. And even here, there is nothing of the sort. If only I had more time to think, but the monsters lurk in every hall now.

Perhaps the damage to the Facility means this is my final life? A pity. So much more to discover and learn.

I woke up for the first time right here. And now I bleed.

When first I heard the Mission, I felt a thrill. We were chosen. We would rule again.

But after spending countless days? nights? Who is to say in these windowless halls.

We do nothing. The Facility feeds us, the Facility provides. And we just... argue.

But now we do more. We turned to murder.

I pray you find this, brother of my blood.

Genghis somehow got a hold of explosives. Last night we woke to a thunderous din.

The Facility has been repeating incessantly: Containment Breached. It is maddening.

An expedition was sent to the outside this morning, they report predators... deadly ones, all about.

Amelia and Amanirenas are furiously working to come up with anything that could be used as a weapon. I tried to get into the Facility's inner sanctum - to no avail.

There is nowhere to hide. Nothing to be done but wait.

Judith Tatienne: I just don't understand where these calculations came from.

Victor Aiza: There something wrong with the math? I think it's quite straightforward.

Judith Tatienne: That's not what I'm asking! We've had no success extracting even a sample of material from the object. No explanation for the gravitational effects. No motion graph to explain its harmonic frequencies. I can't even a establish a melting point!

Victor Aiza: Judith...

Judith Tatienne: But you've had me building these prototype colliders for months! And now you want me to pump Helium-3 into it based on this equation you've written on a god-damned napkin!

Victor Aiza: I just need you to trust me.

Judith Tatienne: I HAVE been trusting you! We keep slamming our heads against a brick wall, getting nothing, and you keep coming up with something new to try, like you know what's going to happen! Where are you getting your information, Victor?

Four hours talking to Victor and his team about theoretical metals, atomic bonding, even a half hour divergence into magnetism that I'm pretty sure was just to throw me off the trail of what we were talking about.

However, the odds of me being found orbiting some star somewhere within your lifetime are marginally better; one in ten to the thirty six thousandth. So on the off chance someone finds my body, and you're still alive, I figured I'd leave you this note.

I should have listened to you. You always were the brains of our duo. I was just the mechanic that put it together. We were a good pair, though. That's how we got so much further than we ever could have imagined; together, lifting each other up, celebrating each others' victories, never needing to stop because we never wanted any more than to be facing this world together.

And I can't help thinking that if I hadn't gone this alone, I wouldn't have ended up here, without you.

I learned enough about statistics from you to know that I'll never get to see you again. But at least I'll get to spend the last of my days loving you, and knowing you loved me too.

<b>Setup</b>

Hey foreman, Dundas and Curtis were able to scrounge up some guns for the ship. For a Miner, Curtis has a nose for weapons. Nenadovic has some suggestions on where to hit remote ships, so we're finally underway. Two or three hits should give us a good haul and then we'll head back. 

- Captain Becker


<b>Going Dark</b>

Hey again, we're in position. Everyone is excited, Rizky maybe too much. But it feels really good to be on this side, hope you'll join us next time. Hate to say it, but mining is for chumps. No offense. 

Don't know how long we'll have to wait, but we can keep ourselves busy. I'm shutting some things down so folks don't give away our position, so you won't hear from us until we're ready to return.

- Captain Becker


<b>Everyone's Pirate Names</b>

Good job on the new names everyone! Please stop using the real ones, they aren't scary enough.

Rosemarie is Rummy C
Aurel is The Asp
Lesley is Vulture, but she isn't "the" Vulture
Miladin is Knifeshadow
Rizky and Yuliana are Risky Rover and Firekat

And we're no longer flying the Dancer In the Darkess either!

<b>Crew Name Suggestions</b>
Date: 4-13-2330

We need to put the fear of God into anyone we attack. As long as folks know we're serious, they should roll right over. No one needs to be shot or stranded. We leave with the goods, and they'll carry on just fine.

Look, we've been raided enough times, this is tough. Knifeshadow had an arm broken, and the Asp's brother is still in a coma from the raid after that, but they're still here because they know we need to be tougher. Give me your best names!

- Bloody Jurgen Sturzstrom, Captain of the Black Dreadnought 


<b>Crew Name</b>

Still accepting suggestions for our crew name. 

The Asp, you're the only one who hasn't given me anything, I need a better commitment.  Risky Rover, I know you have a shtick but the group doesn't share it. Love the enthusiasm but shake up your list and choose a few favorites. The accent is also a bit much, we need to be intimidating.

- Bloody Jurgen Sturzstrom, Captain of the Black Dreadnought


<b>Small Targets</b>

I'm bored too, but we're new at this and need to wait for a small target. Knifeshadow had a few ideas, one will pan out.

- Bloody Jurgen Sturzstrom of the Fists of Titanium, Captain of the Black Dreadnought and scourge of the Big Dark


<b>Aurel Constantin is a hypocrite and a killer</b>

Miladin went in shooting. He wasn't supposed to. But we're pirates, Rizky  shouldn't have been so shocked afterward. They should have been ready for this. Aurel said he didn't want to kill people either. Didn't stop him when the argument got heated and the Captain pulled a gun. Becker went down and everyone started shooting.

Aurel didn't realize I wasn't dead when he gathered up all of the slates and wiped them. Missed this one in the captain's boot just as he missed my breathing.  

He tried to remove all of the evidence and flee in the ship we hit, but I'm letting you know so he can't come home. Don't let him pretend he isn't a killer too.

I cannot believe the moment of awakening is upon us. To merge with the Clemens Comet and be eternal. It is really happening.

I tried to convince Susan to come with me one last time, or at least let me bring Malcolm. She refused to listen to my reasoning. She bawled, said I was leaving our son without a father. But she just doesn't understand. It pains me to leave my family to suffer. But if she cannot see, what more can I do? I have tried to pass on The Star Child's message. If she does not want to receive it, I can do no more.

I do not fear what comes next. I know that the great journey is just beginning.

   Title: Cultist Note 2
I've done the calculations, and it is clear that The Star Child is correct. The Clemens Comet has an average tail length of fifty-six million miles. This tail consists largely of plasma and ionized gas. Readings from The Scientific Spiritual indicate that our souls are made of the same ionized gas. From some independent experiments I've conducted on interactions of gases, I have concluded that if we part our souls from our bodies while in the tail of the comet, as The Star Child suggests, they should seamlessly join with the comets tail.

Some have said that I was foolish to do my own calculations. That it would be preposterous to doubt The Star Child.

I say it is foolish not to do your own research.

This has been the greatest time in my life. Chasing the tail of the Clemens Comet, together with the only rational people in the universe. We are united in our love and passion for the stars, our dreams of the future, our knowledge that we deserve more than what we have. Never before have I met so many like minded people. For the first time, I am not alone.

I almost wish we did not have to join with the Clemens. It is nice to dream of simply traveling the universe forever, a new colony we have built for ourselves.

But the Awakening waits for no one. I know it is what is best for all of us.

I'm finishing up school, and then, hopefully I can get out of here too. But, it's hard because even though my classes cost next to nothing, I still have lots of expenses and I barely have enough to eat. I only earn scraps from Jae and Anja. It's not like they have tons of credits either. And because I have to take time away from my studies, my grades suffer. It sucks. Why is everything so HARD?

How do other people do this? No one around here has really gone to college except for Dr. Lakota, and maybe that new lady, Joyce. Dr. Lakota doesn't really have time for me, and the few times I went for advice, she was just like, "Stick with it, kid, you'll get there if you put in the work."

I don't know what to do. I thought writing it down would help, but now I just have a place I can remember how bad I feel right now, so that's cool.

Although Earth has been left behind, humanity shares an ancient compact between any form of government and its citizens. All individuals enjoy unalienable rights that may not be infringed. A government shall not intervene in purely private affairs. A colony has complete autonomy on how they are governed and to manage its own interstellar relations. And all individuals, in time of great need, owe the government their arms and, if need be blood, if the collective welfare is threatened.

Life on the outer reaches of space can be pretty unpredictable some times.  Here I was, living a quiet life on Space Station 11 when the new Marshall rolls up and accuses me of being an alien! Never mind that humans haven't made contact with intelligent life in the hundreds of years we've been exploring - but this clown INSISTS I'm an alien - and get this - his "evidence" is that I have a beard! He is certain that beards simply don't grow in space.  The guy was obsessed with this absurd conspiracy!  I'm not an alien, I was born on New Pittsburgh!  He was ready to send  me and my colleagues off to space jail - and he was serious.

I can't find the key to the supply chest. The worst part is I just used it the other day so I know it's around here somewhere.

Not sure if I can cut through the container. These crates were designed to resist most laser cutters, but it's worth a shot. I've got a better chance with it than with the digipick, anyway.

Probably doesn't make a difference. At this point I'm dead regardless of whether I get it open.

But when I see this crate in hell I want it to know I won.

I don't know if you'll ever get to read this. I feel like I should write it anyway, in case something happens. If this somehow ever finds its way to you, I hope it brings you the closure that you need. 

The ship has been getting bombarded by solar flares. The systems are out, and the engines are dead. If by some miracle we're able to get things running again, another flare hits us and we're back to square one. We've been sending SOS signals out, but so far it's just been radio silence. I don't think we'll be able to get out of this one. 

I don't really know what else to say, but I just want you to know that I love you. Give the kids a hug and kiss for me.

There's an old Swedish proverb which says luck never gives; it only lends.

So when I drew straws with Gutierrez over who was going to do fix the exterior, I wouldn't say I was given a break. I was just lent a little more time.

Besides, Gutierrez was the better choice. He's always been the brave one. He tried to fight the Fleet when they boarded, and lost a tooth in the scuffle. Me, I hid in a corner. I've got a mouth full of teeth and all they do is chatter.

When the vote came over whether to consume the body, I cast my vote in favor. We needed the energy, and here was our lucky break. But while I felt good at first, I couldn't keep any of the meat down.  

Gutierrez told me I was lucky, and at the time, I agreed. But I was only borrowing it you see, it was never mine to keep.

It's important we stay calm, because the more we panic, the more oxygen we consume. I've asked each crew member to say some words to help distract us from the situation, but I think they misunderstood the assignment.

First Mate Szczerbiak used the moment to give me a eulogy, which started a trend where we each spoke on another's behalf. I reminded them, we still might live. All this talk of death and dying was not my intention.

I can name countless other instances where you steered us away from death's door. And if this is the end, I will take this ending over any other.

Sometimes hauling cargo is like those puzzles you play as a kid. You have to put the pieces in a precise order or else it won't fit. 

This is because in our line of work, crate dimensions don't adhere to any particular standard, or use the same system of measurement. 4 x 8 feet crates will often need to be stacked alongside 3 x 6 meter boxes. Then there's the type of crate. You got fragile goods, dry bulk, wet bulk, etcetera. 

But it's important we be precise. If security does an inspection, they'll see our crates are professionally organized. That goes a long way to looking legitimate.

So when I found the cargo hold a mess after takeoff, I didn't know how to explain it. Maybe it was the condensation on the floors, or crates tumbling over when we hit escape velocity for Moloch I. 

But last night lying in my bed, I heard noises coming from the hold. And I started to wonder if there isn't another explanation that fits.

We land on Moloch I and it's just arid, rocky desert. Mile after mile of brown. But the Captain checks the coordinates and says the cargo's about twenty paces ahead, at the base of a pillar.

We walk toward it, and sure enough, there's a pile of crates just sitting there in the middle of nowhere. Lottie's confident she can get everything to fit, but I don't know. What exactly is in these things? Who left them here?

I've got questions, and the Captain ain't got any answers. All she can think about is the creds. After what we paid for the shields, can't say I blame her.

But maybe I'll head down to the cargo hold, and take a peek inside before we grav jump to Vectera. Given all this secrecy, I figure the information might be worth something to somebody.

These crates we picked up from Moloch I weigh more than a bloody spacetruck. I tell the Quartermaster I think I cracked my dirty brain pushing them and he tells me it's called a "vertebrae," even though I know for a fact he just made that word up. 

Anyway, we're pushing an especially large crate up the ramp, and I call timeout, because I need a break. So I lean back against it and wipe my brow, when suddenly, the crate pushes back. I swear on me mother, the bloody thing SHOOK.

Meanwhile the Quartermaster's pissed because I'm backing away and the crate's sliding back down the ramp. He's calling me a lazy oaf and all manner of childish insults. When I tell him the crate's got something innit, he says "Of course it gots something in it. What do you think we're smuggling, air?" and kicks the thing. I tell him, he shouldn't do that.

I've always had trouble making new friends. In school they used to call me "Qwerty," because I needed a computer to express myself. And when I did talk, I'd say something awkward, and people would laugh. 

People think the only time I'm funny is when I don't mean to be.

Well, I disagree! It's not that I don't have a sense of humor, I'm just not used to using my outside voice! I get anxious in big crowds and just clam up. 

So I've been trying to practice by talking to one of the Model As on board, who I've affectionately named Qwerty. Why? Because robots are funny even when they don't mean to be, just like me.

But ever since the Spacer attack, I feel like something's changed. I can't quite put my finger on why, but it's like every robot on this ship is stuck in combat mode, and they're constantly on alert. Qwerty won't talk to me about casual things, and what's worse, he'll sometimes forget my name.

I talked to May about it and she said I shouldn't worry. Robots do 3D facial scanning, vocal recognition, and full body biometric data scanning, and cross-reference it with the crew database. I joked that maybe Qwerty should buy me a drink first, and May laughed!

I was so happy that I made a joke in person, I ran to Qwerty to tell him the news. But he didn't even care, he just wanted to patrol the deck. Something's still off.

Ever since that dust up with Spacers near Bessel II the robots on this ship have been acting strangely. I've chided the Captain in the past about not running periodic OS checks but we've recently completed a firmware update so I don't think it's that.

Several of the crew members are claiming the robots will on occasion deny them access to the bunks, kitchen, and cockpit, asking them if they have clearance. I've noted that we're dealing with decommissioned UC Navy models, and some sort of remnant programming could be rearing its ugly head.

Atheism was just the first step, for me.

I was raised in a world of right and wrong. I walked among chosen people. Each night, my family would gather and pray for the sinners in our lives to find salvation.

I can't tell you exactly when I stopped believing in these things. Like many who lose their faith, for me the cracks formed slowly over time: an illogical verse here, an unanswered question there. One day, you realize you're working hard to hold onto something false. You don't want to lose your community, or your connection to your family. But sometimes, maybe things that don't make sense are just wrong.

The details of my awakening aren't important, but what came next is. I never expected that losing my faith would begin a profound new chapter in my life: a time of deep compassion and charity, as a member of the Enlightened.

Part II:

My settlement was founded as a commune by the members of my family's church: a place where the congregation could worship in peace, without interference. 

But word travels fast, and our small colony began to grow. Our success attracted those in need of help, and those with nowhere else to turn.

When I was 10 years old, I watched two officers lead a frail-looking man down our street. He had been stealing from our settlement's emergency rations. Our local security had been trying to catch the thief for weeks.

I asked my parents if the man was hungry. If he didn't have enough to eat, couldn't we feed him the same food he had been stealing?

My parents explained that while our settlement probably could afford to feed the man, stealing is a sin, and the thief must ask God for forgiveness. That night, my family gathered to pray for the soul of the man. They asked God to help him see beyond a life of sin. 

That man's name was Edgar, and he didn't need our prayers. Edgar needed food, and work. Since no one gave him either, Edgar would be in and out of our settlement's prison for several years to come.

Jake and the Enu: A Tale of Enlightenment

Part 1:
 
Since he was a boy, Jake's family had protected the Enu, the ancient creatures who brought life to his mountain. Each day, Jake would enter their cave and clean the stone statues that connected the Enu to this world. He kept their location secret, and shielded the Enu from the greedy men who lived in the valley of the mountain. Jake was always kind to his wife and sons, so that he could tell the Enu of his good deeds.
 
The Enu rewarded Jake's devotion by bringing his family the life-giving stream. Each spring, it would flow from the mouth of their cave, and bless his fields with a bountiful harvest. This blessing had only grown stronger each year. Jake's farmland was so prosperous that it covered the mountain, and was seen by those in the valley.
 
One day, two men visited Jake's farm.
 
"Let us buy your grains, and your fruits," They said, "for none will grow, beyond the mountain." But Jake turned them away. 

"The valley has run dry, and surely you could make do with less." But the men's coins were of no use to Jake, for he received all that he needed from the Enu.
 
One night, Jake woke to sounds coming from the Enu's cave. He raced to the entrance, only to find the cave filled with men from the valley. Each one held a Enu statue, and was carrying it down from the mountain.

Jake cried for them to stop, but one man held him at the mouth of the cave. "The lands of the valley are dying." he said, "These spirits can bring us water, but you have kept them all to yourself. We will leave what you have already grown, but we are taking the Enu to the valley."

Part 2:
 
Jake cursed and pleaded with the thieves, but it was no use. Soon, every Enu was removed from the cave. Jake wept. What would become of the mountain? He continued visiting the cave each day. He cleaned the floors where the Enu had stood, and recited his good deeds to the walls. Jake dreaded the spring. Without the gift of the Enu's stream, what would become of his fields?
 
Then, in the spring, the stream flowed from the cave anyway.
 
Jake was confused, but his family wasted no time. They cultivated their fields, and that summer, they saw their most bountiful harvest in years.
 
The following spring, the stream appeared again. Jake began to wonder - were more Enu hiding in the cave? He waded into the stream, and traveled beyond the Enu's cavern - much further than he had before.
 
But instead of more Enu, Jake found a large, underground lake. 
 
He also found tunnels, bringing fresh water into the cave from the rainy side of the mountain.
 
Later that day, Jake traveled down to the village in the valley. He found its people desperate, and their lands parched. Jake visited the farms of the village. He found an Enu statue placed in each one, but he could see that the rocky, dry land would never grow fruit.
 
That evening, Jake returned to his wife, and shared what he had seen. They spent all night looking down on the valley. In the morning, they called for their sons, and the family harvested their fields. They packed half of all they had grown in large, wooden carts.

The next day, Jake stood at the mouth of the Enu's cave. He turned, and joined his family as they traveled down the mountain.

   Title: Experiment Results
I think we've done it. The plants are showing a 200% acceleration in growth. The plants should reach maturity at a rate well beyond anything seen in nature.

I expect them to continue growing rapidly. I look forward to the final results.

   Title: For Saanvi
The grab was a success. 

I think we should store the case in here for a few weeks. UC Security will be on alert, now that something's gone missing from the surface. That's the only reason they do anything down here.

I don't expect anyone else to know about this room. Honestly, we may be the first ones to come here, in years.

Hey kiddo,

I know this is your first flight, and I just want to wish you luck, and give you some words of advice. Because the truth is, I'm worried. Not about your safety, your mother has that department cornered. 

I'm worried the poets are wrong, and the cynics are right. I'm worried that when you finally live your dream of going to space, that you won't like it.

See, when you were a kid, all you did was wait. You had to wait for school to end so you could watch those space cartoons. You had to wait for your birthday before we bought you that toy spaceship. But most days, you spent waiting until you were old enough. Old enough to take your first piloting lessons, get your first ship, and join your first crew.

Now that you're finally old enough, I'm worried. Because if being a kid is full of waiting, being an adult is about disappointment. It's about getting what you always wanted, only to wonder, is that all there is?

Well, I'm here to tell you, screw the cynics. There are things in life worth waiting for. You and your mother were that for me. I'm hoping and praying this job is that for you.

Shoot for the stars kiddo. We'll be here when you touch back down.
 
Dad
