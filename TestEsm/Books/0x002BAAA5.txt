Wendy, 

I need you back here on Gagarin as soon as possible. 

I know you're tired too. So, I'm doubling your salary and I've hired another lawyer who should arrive from Akila City in a few months. 

Also, the law firm will become the Offices of Yankton and Apple -- you will be a full partner here. It's time. I should have done that sooner.

Please accept this contract addendum and return to Gagarin as soon as possible. Gagarin needs more than just one tired public lawyer.
