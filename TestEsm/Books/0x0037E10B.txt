I wish I had done more. Seen more.

I can't stop thinking about all those years I wasted. All those times I thought about doing something, anything, and just finding my way back to bed.

Then I finally did it. I signed up for this crew and went out into space.

And just like that, I'm out of time. Isn't that always how it is?
