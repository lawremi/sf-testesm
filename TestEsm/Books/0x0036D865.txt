We've been stuck in this room for days. There's so little oxygen in our tanks you can probably count the molecules on one hand.

But I've told the crew to ration slowly, and keep their heartbeats still. We'll try to stay alive as long as we can, in case another ship finds us.

It's important we stay calm, because the more we panic, the more oxygen we consume. I've asked each crew member to say some words to help distract us from the situation, but I think they misunderstood the assignment.

First Mate Szczerbiak used the moment to give me a eulogy, which started a trend where we each spoke on another's behalf. I reminded them, we still might live. All this talk of death and dying was not my intention. 

But at the same time, talking about each other reminds us what we're living for. So, I let it go.
