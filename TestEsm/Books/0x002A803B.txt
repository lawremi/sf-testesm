Station log. Judith Tatienne. I've been trying to cozy up to Doctor Aiza... Victor... to see what is going on. 

His team has completely commandeered one of the labs with those two military handlers checking who comes in and out.

I joked that maybe he found a little gray man and was doing an autopsy, and he grew very pale. 

Two days later, he sends me a request asking for more information on my background in materials science - metallurgical engineering. We have a meeting tomorrow.

I... I think I'm being invited into the lab...
