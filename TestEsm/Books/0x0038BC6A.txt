Charity in a Godless Universe

Part I:

Atheism was just the first step, for me.

I was raised in a world of right and wrong. I walked among chosen people. Each night, my family would gather and pray for the sinners in our lives to find salvation.

I can't tell you exactly when I stopped believing in these things. Like many who lose their faith, for me the cracks formed slowly over time: an illogical verse here, an unanswered question there. One day, you realize you're working hard to hold onto something false. You don't want to lose your community, or your connection to your family. But sometimes, maybe things that don't make sense are just wrong.

The details of my awakening aren't important, but what came next is. I never expected that losing my faith would begin a profound new chapter in my life: a time of deep compassion and charity, as a member of the Enlightened.
