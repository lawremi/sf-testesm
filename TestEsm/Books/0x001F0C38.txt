We scouted the perfect spot on Bessel III. A little outpost where a bunch of bookworms spend there time doing who knows what. Best part is... it's completely unguarded.

Take care of anyone there, and we've got ourselves a secluded spot to do whatever we need without anyone finding out.

Easy job, don't screw this up.
