My damn birthday is just around the corner, and I've got some important people to keep happy. So, listen up.

I'm gonna need you to order lots of caviar, champagne, whiskey, and cigars. None of that cheap stuff either, I don't care where you import it from. Just don't embarrass me in front of these guys.

And yes, I realize that it's a couple days away. Just get it done.
