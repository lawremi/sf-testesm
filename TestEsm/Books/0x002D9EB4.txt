I've been doing some calculating. By my estimation, there is a one in ten to the seventy eight billionth chance of me drifting into range of another ship before my rations run out. However, the odds of me being found orbiting some star somewhere within your lifetime are marginally better; one in ten to the thirty six thousandth. So on the off chance someone finds my body, and you're still alive, I figured I'd leave you this note.

I should have listened to you. You always were the brains of our duo. I was just the mechanic that put it together. We were a good pair, though. That's how we got so much further than we ever could have imagined; together, lifting each other up, celebrating each others' victories, never needing to stop because we never wanted any more than to be facing this world together.

And I can't help thinking that if I hadn't gone this alone, I wouldn't have ended up here, without you.

I learned enough about statistics from you to know that I'll never get to see you again. But at least I'll get to spend the last of my days loving you, and knowing you loved me too.
