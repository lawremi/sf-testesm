Everyone's gone, I just know it. I heard horrible screaming, and then... silence. 

They're out there. I can hear them looking for me, and they know I'm here somewhere. I can't stay holed up in this spot forever. I'm desperate, and I don't want to find out what they're gonna do to me.

I have no idea how you found us but I hope you rot in hell! We did nothing to you...

If anyone that actually cares reads this, tell my family I love them.

I'm sorry.
