Iris! I still remember the day you tracked me down at The Broken Spear.

You came at me with a resume and list of qualifications longer than a sporeback's neck. At first I only said "yes" so you'd stop badgering me.

But having you on this crew has been a delight. As a Captain I like to go with the flow. Iris, you measure the flow, graph it, and then come up with a plan to smoothly ride it before we've even set course.

So having your counsel and energy on this ship has been invaluable. And also, he won't admit it, but I think Pete likes you. Sorry Pete. If you're not going to say it, I will.

Your Captain,
