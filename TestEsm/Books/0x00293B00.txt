This is Vanguard Moara. Sorry if I had to reclaim some UC property, but this whole staryard is overrun. I've patched up my ship, and I'm heading to Neptune.

Going to put in another request to get the Fleet out here to deal with these Spacers. But until then, if any of you thugs are listening, I'm the damn ghost stealing your stuff in the night. Clear out while you have the chance.
