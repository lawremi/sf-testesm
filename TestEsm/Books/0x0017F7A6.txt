I have attached all of the star data that Constellation was collecting about the anomalies. They appear to have gotten quite far. Praise the Great Serpent that we were able to stop them before their blasphemy could spread further.

There is also a planet that matches data found on one of the Artifacts, but much larger. This warrants further investigation. I have added a program onboard Constellation's deep scanner, the Eye, that should hopefully locate more as we find more of these Artifacts.
