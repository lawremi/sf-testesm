It's been a crazy 24 hours and I'm exhausted. Trident short-staffed the flight so that left three of us who had to stay up all night to set up the Starview Ballroom. Place looks amazing, but I doubt the snobby "TPS" passengers will even notice. Anyone that has enough money to ride on the Siren certainly isn't going to care about the effort we put in to keep them comfortable. Really ticks me off how those rich folk just expect all of it to happen.

Maybe it's time I took Havertino up on his offer to transfer to Trident's Cargo Division. Honest work and no one thumbing their nose up at me? Sounds tempting.
