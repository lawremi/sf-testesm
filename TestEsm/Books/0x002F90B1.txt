Life on the outer reaches of space can be pretty unpredictable some times.  Here I was, living a quiet life on Space Station 11 when the new Marshall rolls up and accuses me of being an alien! Never mind that humans haven't made contact with intelligent life in the hundreds of years we've been exploring - but this clown INSISTS I'm an alien - and get this - his "evidence" is that I have a beard! He is certain that beards simply don't grow in space.  The guy was obsessed with this absurd conspiracy!  I'm not an alien, I was born on New Pittsburgh!  He was ready to send  me and my colleagues off to space jail - and he was serious.  After we realized that this wasn't a joke and he was serious, we bounced out of there before he could get security to round us up.  I guess that's what you'd call a "close shave".
