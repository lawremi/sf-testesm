This is an absolute disaster. You never told me that I'd only be able to take one valet on this cruise. Imagine how it felt when I had to send the other three home at the Siren's departure station! You won't believe it but I actually had to CARRY MY OWN BAG. Can you imagine the humiliation? 

Oh well, at least the food on board is halfway decent. The wine, however? Disgusting. I think Trident neglected to hire a proper sommelier. Thank goodness I brought a few bottles from our cellars.

Anyway, that's all for now. I guess I'll see you when this horror show is over. 

As always, your loving son, Hannibal.

Okay, now how the hell do you... how do you send this? Hello? Isn't this voice activated? No, you stupid thing, stop printing what I'm... *unintelligible*... this is preposterous. Send! Send! No, send! You stupid piece of junk. Wait until my father hears about this.
