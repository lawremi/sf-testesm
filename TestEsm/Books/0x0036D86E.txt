Man, I was hoping to get the Captain, so eulogizing the First Mate is a big let down. It kind of describes Aleksy's entire life, really. Always the bridesmaid, never the bride.

But jokes aside, I love you like a brother. When I first became a part of this crew, I felt like I had to pretend I knew everything. I mean Iris actually DOES know everything, so it was tough to compete with that, you know?

Aleksy, you always made sure I didn't feel like a dumbass whenever I screwed up. You'd have a story about the time you crashed the ship, or spilled beer on the pilot's console and... oh right! That was a secret! Sorry Captain, that's why the controls are sticky. My bad Aleksy.

No really though, even as the new kid here, I never felt uncomfortable. That's all because you took me under your wing. You were a guardian angel in life, my man, and you'll be one in death too. 

Love you,
Pete
